  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2022 Language. It is the thirteenth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.</p>
  <p>The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.</p>
  <p>That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.</p>
  <p>The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.</p>
  <p>After publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition.</p>
  <p>The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5<sup>th</sup> edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and added support for new features that had emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. The fifth edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 2009.</p>
  <p>The fifth edition was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011. Edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard incorporated minor corrections and is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011. The 5.1 Edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 2011.</p>
  <p>Focused development of the sixth edition started in 2009, as the fifth edition was being prepared for publication. However, this was preceded by significant experimentation and language enhancement design efforts dating to the publication of the third edition in 1999. In a very real sense, the completion of the sixth edition is the culmination of a fifteen year effort. The goals for this edition included providing better support for large applications, library creation, and for use of ECMAScript as a compilation target for other languages. Some of its major enhancements included modules, class declarations, lexical block scoping, iterators and generators, promises for asynchronous programming, destructuring patterns, and proper tail calls. The ECMAScript library of built-ins was expanded to support additional data abstractions including maps, sets, and arrays of binary numeric values as well as additional support for Unicode supplemental characters in strings and regular expressions. The built-ins were also made extensible via subclassing. The sixth edition provides the foundation for regular, incremental language and library enhancements. The sixth edition was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript 2016 was the first ECMAScript edition released under Ecma TC39's new yearly release cadence and open development process. A plain-text source document was built from the ECMAScript 2015 source document to serve as the base for further development entirely on GitHub. Over the year of this standard's development, hundreds of pull requests and issues were filed representing thousands of bug fixes, editorial fixes and other improvements. Additionally, numerous software tools were developed to aid in this effort including Ecmarkup, Ecmarkdown, and Grammarkdown. ES2016 also included support for a new exponentiation operator and adds a new method to `Array.prototype` called `includes`.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript 2017 introduced Async Functions, Shared Memory, and Atomics along with smaller language and library enhancements, bug fixes, and editorial updates. Async functions improve the asynchronous programming experience by providing syntax for promise-returning functions. Shared Memory and Atomics introduce a new memory model that allows multi-agent programs to communicate using atomic operations that ensure a well-defined execution order even on parallel CPUs. It also included new static methods on Object: `Object.values`, `Object.entries`, and `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors`.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript 2018 introduced support for asynchronous iteration via the AsyncIterator protocol and async generators. It also included four new regular expression features: the `dotAll` flag, named capture groups, Unicode property escapes, and look-behind assertions. Lastly it included object rest and spread properties.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript 2019 introduced a few new built-in functions: `flat` and `flatMap` on `Array.prototype` for flattening arrays, `Object.fromEntries` for directly turning the return value of `Object.entries` into a new Object, and `trimStart` and `trimEnd` on `String.prototype` as better-named alternatives to the widely implemented but non-standard `String.prototype.trimLeft` and `trimRight` built-ins. In addition, it included a few minor updates to syntax and semantics. Updated syntax included optional catch binding parameters and allowing U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR) and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) in string literals to align with JSON. Other updates included requiring that `Array.prototype.sort` be a stable sort, requiring that `JSON.stringify` return well-formed UTF-8 regardless of input, and clarifying `Function.prototype.toString` by requiring that it either return the corresponding original source text or a standard placeholder.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript 2020, the 11<sup>th</sup> edition, introduces the `matchAll` method for Strings, to produce an iterator for all match objects generated by a global regular expression; `import()`, a syntax to asynchronously import Modules with a dynamic specifier; `BigInt`, a new number primitive for working with arbitrary precision integers; `Promise.allSettled`, a new Promise combinator that does not short-circuit; `globalThis`, a universal way to access the global `this` value; dedicated `export * as ns from 'module'` syntax for use within modules; increased standardization of `for-in` enumeration order; `import.meta`, a host-populated object available in Modules that may contain contextual information about the Module; as well as adding two new syntax features to improve working with &ldquo;nullish&rdquo; values (`null` or `undefined`): nullish coalescing, a value selection operator; and optional chaining, a property access and function invocation operator that short-circuits if the value to access/invoke is nullish.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript 2021, the 12<sup>th</sup> edition, introduces the `replaceAll` method for Strings; `Promise.any`, a Promise combinator that short-circuits when an input value is fulfilled; `AggregateError`, a new Error type to represent multiple errors at once; logical assignment operators (`??=`, `&&=`, `||=`); `WeakRef`, for referring to a target object without preserving it from garbage collection, and `FinalizationRegistry`, to manage registration and unregistration of cleanup operations performed when target objects are garbage collected; separators for numeric literals (`1_000`); and `Array.prototype.sort` was made more precise, reducing the amount of cases that result in an implementation-defined sort order.</p>
  <p>Dozens of individuals representing many organizations have made very significant contributions within Ecma TC39 to the development of this edition and to the prior editions. In addition, a vibrant community has emerged supporting TC39's ECMAScript efforts. This community has reviewed numerous drafts, filed thousands of bug reports, performed implementation experiments, contributed test suites, and educated the world-wide developer community about ECMAScript. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify and acknowledge every person and organization who has contributed to this effort.</p>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general-purpose programming language. A <em>scripting language</em> is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a host environment of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and non-professional programmers.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be a <em>Web scripting language</em>, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular host environment.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript usage has moved beyond simple scripting and it is now used for the full spectrum of programming tasks in many different environments and scales. As the usage of ECMAScript has expanded, so have the features and facilities it provides. ECMAScript is now a fully featured general-purpose programming language.</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-web-scripting">
    <h1>Web Scripting</h1>
    <p>A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including, for instance, objects that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output. Further, the host environment provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading, unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction, and there is no need for a main program.</p>
    <p>A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including objects representing requests, clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is possible to distribute computation between the client and server while providing a customized user interface for a Web-based application.</p>
    <p>Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment, completing the ECMAScript execution environment.</p>
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="sec-hosts-and-implementations">
    <h1>Hosts and Implementations</h1>
    <p>To aid integrating ECMAScript into host environments, this specification defers the definition of certain facilities (e.g., abstract operations), either in whole or in part, to a source outside of this specification. Editorially, this specification distinguishes the following kinds of deferrals.</p>
    <!-- "implementation" below is not a dfn but an em to avoid excessive auto-linking. -->
    <p>An <em id="implementation">implementation</em> is an external source that further defines facilities enumerated in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-host-layering-points"></emu-xref> or those that are marked as implementation-defined or implementation-approximated. In informal use, an implementation refers to a concrete artefact, such as a particular web browser.</p>
    <p>An <dfn id="implementation-defined">implementation-defined</dfn> facility is one that defers its definition to an external source without further qualification. This specification does not make any recommendations for particular behaviours, and conforming implementations are free to choose any behaviour within the constraints put forth by this specification.</p>
    <p>An <dfn id="implementation-approximated">implementation-approximated</dfn> facility is one that defers its definition to an external source while recommending an ideal behaviour. While conforming implementations are free to choose any behaviour within the constraints put forth by this specification, they are encouraged to strive to approximate the ideal. Some mathematical operations, such as <emu-xref href="#sec-math.exp"><code>Math.exp</code></emu-xref>, are implementation-approximated.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="host" variants="hosts">host</dfn> is an external source that further defines facilities listed in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-host-layering-points"></emu-xref> but does not further define other implementation-defined or implementation-approximated facilities. In informal use, a host refers to the set of all implementations, such as the set of all web browsers, that interface with this specification in the same way via Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-host-layering-points"></emu-xref>. A host is often an external specification, such as WHATWG HTML (<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">https://html.spec.whatwg.org/</a>). In other words, facilities that are host-defined are often further defined in external specifications.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="host-hook" variants="host hooks">host hook</dfn> is an abstract operation that is defined in whole or in part by an external source. All host hooks must be listed in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-host-layering-points"></emu-xref>. A host hook must conform to at least the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It must return either a normal completion or a throw completion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <dfn id="host-defined">host-defined</dfn> facility is one that defers its definition to an external source without further qualification and is listed in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-host-layering-points"></emu-xref>. Implementations that are not hosts may also provide definitions for host-defined facilities.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="host-environment" variants="host environments">host environment</dfn> is a particular choice of definition for all host-defined facilities. A host environment typically includes objects or functions which allow obtaining input and providing output as host-defined properties of the global object.</p>
    <p>This specification follows the editorial convention of always using the most specific term. For example, if a facility is host-defined, it should not be referred to as implementation-defined.</p>
    <p>Both hosts and implementations may interface with this specification via the language types, specification types, abstract operations, grammar productions, intrinsic objects, and intrinsic symbols defined herein.</p>
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-overview">
    <h1>ECMAScript Overview</h1>
    <p>The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript&mdash;not all parts of the language are described. This overview is not part of the standard proper.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an <em>object</em> is a collection of zero or more <em>properties</em> each with <em>attributes</em> that determine how each property can be used&mdash;for example, when the Writable attribute for a property is set to *false*, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to assign a different value to the property fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects, <em>primitive values</em>, or <em>functions</em>. A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: <b>Undefined</b>, <b>Null</b>, <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Number</b>, <b>BigInt</b>, <b>String</b>, and <b>Symbol;</b> an object is a member of the built-in type <b>Object</b>; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a <em>method</em>.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript defines a collection of <em>built-in objects</em> that round out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object; objects that are fundamental to the runtime semantics of the language including `Object`, `Function`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, and various `Error` objects; objects that represent and manipulate numeric values including `Math`, `Number`, and `Date`; the text processing objects `String` and `RegExp`; objects that are indexed collections of values including `Array` and nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation; keyed collections including `Map` and `Set` objects; objects supporting structured data including the `JSON` object, `ArrayBuffer`, `SharedArrayBuffer`, and `DataView`; objects supporting control abstractions including generator functions and `Promise` objects; and reflection objects including `Proxy` and `Reflect`.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript also defines a set of built-in <em>operators</em>. ECMAScript operators include various unary operations, multiplicative operators, additive operators, bitwise shift operators, relational operators, equality operators, binary bitwise operators, binary logical operators, assignment operators, and the comma operator.</p>
    <p>Large ECMAScript programs are supported by <em>modules</em> which allow a program to be divided into multiple sequences of statements and declarations. Each module explicitly identifies declarations it uses that need to be provided by other modules and which of its declarations are available for use by other modules.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript syntax intentionally resembles Java syntax. ECMAScript syntax is relaxed to enable it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language. For example, a variable is not required to have its type declared nor are types associated with properties, and defined functions are not required to have their declarations appear textually before calls to them.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-objects">
      <h1>Objects</h1>
      <p>Even though ECMAScript includes syntax for class definitions, ECMAScript objects are not fundamentally class-based such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may be created in various ways including via a literal notation or via <em>constructors</em> which create objects and then execute code that initializes all or part of them by assigning initial values to their properties. Each constructor is a function that has a property named *"prototype"* that is used to implement <em>prototype-based inheritance</em> and <em>shared properties</em>. Objects are created by using constructors in <b>new</b> expressions; for example, `new Date(2009, 11)` creates a new Date object. Invoking a constructor without using <b>new</b> has consequences that depend on the constructor. For example, `Date()` produces a string representation of the current date and time rather than an object.</p>
      <p>Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called the object's <em>prototype</em>) to the value of its constructor's *"prototype"* property. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the <em>prototype chain</em>. When a reference is made to a property in an object, that reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the prototype chain that contains a property of that name. In other words, first the object mentioned directly is examined for such a property; if that object contains the named property, that is the property to which the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named property, the prototype for that object is examined next; and so on.</p>
      <emu-figure id="figure-1" caption="Object/Prototype Relationships">
        <object data="img/figure-1.svg" height="354" type="image/svg+xml" width="719"><img alt="An image of lots of boxes and arrows." height="354" src="img/figure-1.png" width="719"></object>
      </emu-figure>
      <p>In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.</p>
      <p>All objects that do not directly contain a particular property that their prototype contains share that property and its value. Figure 1 illustrates this:</p>
      <p><b>CF</b> is a constructor (and also an object). Five objects have been created by using `new` expressions: <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. Each of these objects contains properties named *"q1"* and *"q2"*. The dashed lines represent the implicit prototype relationship; so, for example, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>'s prototype is <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>. The constructor, <b>CF</b>, has two properties itself, named *"P1"* and *"P2"*, which are not visible to <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, or <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. The property named *"CFP1"* in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b> is shared by <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> (but not by <b>CF</b>), as are any properties found in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>'s implicit prototype chain that are not named *"q1"*, *"q2"*, or *"CFP1"*. Notice that there is no implicit prototype link between <b>CF</b> and <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most class-based object languages, properties can be added to objects dynamically by assigning values to them. That is, constructors are not required to name or assign values to all or any of the constructed object's properties. In the above diagram, one could add a new shared property for <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> by assigning a new value to the property in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>
      <p>Although ECMAScript objects are not inherently class-based, it is often convenient to define class-like abstractions based upon a common pattern of constructor functions, prototype objects, and methods. The ECMAScript built-in objects themselves follow such a class-like pattern. Beginning with ECMAScript 2015, the ECMAScript language includes syntactic class definitions that permit programmers to concisely define objects that conform to the same class-like abstraction pattern used by the built-in objects.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-strict-variant-of-ecmascript">
      <h1>The Strict Variant of ECMAScript</h1>
      <p>The ECMAScript Language recognizes the possibility that some users of the language may wish to restrict their usage of some features available in the language. They might do so in the interests of security, to avoid what they consider to be error-prone features, to get enhanced error checking, or for other reasons of their choosing. In support of this possibility, ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The strict variant of the language excludes some specific syntactic and semantic features of the regular ECMAScript language and modifies the detailed semantics of some features. The strict variant also specifies additional error conditions that must be reported by throwing error exceptions in situations that are not specified as errors by the non-strict form of the language.</p>
      <p>The strict variant of ECMAScript is commonly referred to as the <em>strict mode</em> of the language. Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode syntax and semantics of ECMAScript is explicitly made at the level of individual ECMAScript source text units as described in <emu-xref href="#sec-strict-mode-code"></emu-xref>. Because strict mode is selected at the level of a syntactic source text unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions that have local effect within such a source text unit. Strict mode does not restrict or modify any aspect of the ECMAScript semantics that must operate consistently across multiple source text units. A complete ECMAScript program may be composed of both strict mode and non-strict mode ECMAScript source text units. In this case, strict mode only applies when actually executing code that is defined within a strict mode source text unit.</p>
      <p>In order to conform to this specification, an ECMAScript implementation must implement both the full unrestricted ECMAScript language and the strict variant of the ECMAScript language as defined by this specification. In addition, an implementation must support the combination of unrestricted and strict mode source text units into a single composite program.</p>

      <h1>Context-Free Grammars</h1>
      <p>A <em>context-free grammar</em> consists of a number of <em>productions</em>. Each production has an abstract symbol called a <em>nonterminal</em> as its <em>left-hand side</em>, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and <em>terminal</em> symbols as its <em>right-hand side</em>. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.</p>
      <p>A <dfn variants="chain productions">chain production</dfn> is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.</p>
      <p>Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the <dfn variants="goal symbols">goal symbol</dfn>, a given context-free grammar specifies a <em>language</em>, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars">
      <h1>The Lexical and RegExp Grammars</h1>
      <p>A <em>lexical grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar"></emu-xref>. This grammar has as its terminal symbols Unicode code points that conform to the rules for |SourceCharacter| defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-source-text"></emu-xref>. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol |InputElementDiv|, |InputElementTemplateTail|, or |InputElementRegExp|, or |InputElementRegExpOrTemplateTail|, that describe how sequences of such code points are translated into a sequence of input elements.</p>
      <p>Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript <em>tokens</em>. These tokens are the reserved words, identifiers, literals, and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line terminators, although not considered to be tokens, also become part of the stream of input elements and guide the process of automatic semicolon insertion (<emu-xref href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>). Simple white space and single-line comments are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar. A |MultiLineComment| (that is, a comment of the form `/*`&hellip;`*/` regardless of whether it spans more than one line) is likewise simply discarded if it contains no line terminator; but if a |MultiLineComment| contains one or more line terminators, then it is replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar.</p>
      <p>A <em>RegExp grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in <emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>. This grammar also has as its terminal symbols the code points as defined by |SourceCharacter|. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol |Pattern|, that describe how sequences of code points are translated into regular expression patterns.</p>
      <p>Productions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by having two colons &ldquo;<b>::</b>&rdquo; as separating punctuation. The lexical and RegExp grammars share some productions.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-numeric-string-grammar">
      <h1>The Numeric String Grammar</h1>
      <p>Another grammar is used for translating Strings into numeric values. This grammar is similar to the part of the lexical grammar having to do with numeric literals and has as its terminal symbols |SourceCharacter|. This grammar appears in <emu-xref href="#sec-tonumber-applied-to-the-string-type"></emu-xref>.</p>
      <p>Productions of the numeric string grammar are distinguished by having three colons &ldquo;<b>:::</b>&rdquo; as punctuation.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-syntactic-grammar">
      <h1>The Syntactic Grammar</h1>
      <p>The <em>syntactic grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in clauses <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-expressions"></emu-xref> through <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules"></emu-xref>. This grammar has ECMAScript tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols (<emu-xref href="#sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars"></emu-xref>). It defines a set of productions, starting from two alternative goal symbols |Script| and |Module|, that describe how sequences of tokens form syntactically correct independent components of ECMAScript programs.</p>
      <p>When a stream of code points is to be parsed as an ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|, it is first converted to a stream of input elements by repeated application of the lexical grammar; this stream of input elements is then parsed by a single application of the syntactic grammar. The input stream is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single instance of the goal nonterminal (|Script| or |Module|), with no tokens left over.</p>
      <p>When a parse is successful, it constructs a <em>parse tree</em>, a rooted tree structure in which each node is a <dfn variants="Parse Nodes">Parse Node</dfn>. Each Parse Node is an <em>instance</em> of a symbol in the grammar; it represents a span of the source text that can be derived from that symbol. The root node of the parse tree, representing the whole of the source text, is an instance of the parse's goal symbol. When a Parse Node is an instance of a nonterminal, it is also an instance of some production that has that nonterminal as its left-hand side. Moreover, it has zero or more <em>children</em>, one for each symbol on the production's right-hand side: each child is a Parse Node that is an instance of the corresponding symbol.</p>
      <p>New Parse Nodes are instantiated for each invocation of the parser and never reused between parses even of identical source text. Parse Nodes are considered <dfn>the same Parse Node</dfn> if and only if they represent the same span of source text, are instances of the same grammar symbol, and resulted from the same parser invocation.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>Parsing the same String multiple times will lead to different Parse Nodes. For example, consider:</p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
          let str = "1 + 1;";
          eval(str);
          eval(str);
        </code></pre>
        <p>Each call to `eval` converts the value of `str` into ECMAScript source text and performs an independent parse that creates its own separate tree of Parse Nodes. The trees are distinct even though each parse operates upon a source text that was derived from the same String value.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>Parse Nodes are specification artefacts, and implementations are not required to use an analogous data structure.</emu-note>
      <p>Productions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just one colon &ldquo;<b>:</b>&rdquo; as punctuation.</p>
      <p>The syntactic grammar as presented in clauses <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-expressions"></emu-xref> through <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules"></emu-xref> is not a complete account of which token sequences are accepted as a correct ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|. Certain additional token sequences are also accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only semicolons were added to the sequence in certain places (such as before line terminator characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that are described by the grammar are not considered acceptable if a line terminator character appears in certain &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; places.</p>
      <p>In certain cases, in order to avoid ambiguities, the syntactic grammar uses generalized productions that permit token sequences that do not form a valid ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|. For example, this technique is used for object literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more restrictive <em>supplemental grammar</em> is provided that further restricts the acceptable token sequences. Typically, an early error rule will then state that, in certain contexts, "_P_ <dfn id="must-cover">must cover</dfn> an _N_", where _P_ is a Parse Node (an instance of the generalized production) and _N_ is a nonterminal from the supplemental grammar.

      <h1>Grammar Notation</h1>
      <p>In the ECMAScript grammars, some terminal symbols are shown in `fixed-width` font. These are to appear in a source text exactly as written. All terminal symbol code points specified in this way are to be understood as the appropriate Unicode code points from the Basic Latin range, as opposed to any similar-looking code points from other Unicode ranges. A code point in a terminal symbol cannot be expressed by a `\\` |UnicodeEscapeSequence|.</p>
      <p>In grammars whose terminal symbols are individual Unicode code points (i.e., the lexical, RegExp, and numeric string grammars), a contiguous run of multiple fixed-width code points appearing in a production is a simple shorthand for the same sequence of code points, written as standalone terminal symbols.</p>
      <p>For example, the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        HexIntegerLiteral :: `0x` HexDigits
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a shorthand for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="example">
        HexIntegerLiteral :: `0` `x` HexDigits
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>In contrast, in the syntactic grammar, a contiguous run of fixed-width code points is a single terminal symbol.</p>
      <p>Terminal symbols come in two other forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the lexical and RegExp grammars, Unicode code points without a conventional printed representation are instead shown in the form "&lt;ABBREV&gt;" where "ABBREV" is a mnemonic for the code point. These forms are defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-unicode-format-control-characters" title></emu-xref> and <emu-xref href="#sec-white-space" title></emu-xref>.</li>
        <li>In the syntactic grammar, certain terminal symbols (e.g. |IdentifierName| and |RegularExpressionLiteral|) are shown in italics, as they refer to the nonterminals of the same name in the lexical grammar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nonterminal symbols are shown in <i>italic</i> type. The definition of a nonterminal (also called a &ldquo;production&rdquo;) is introduced by the name of the nonterminal being defined followed by one or more colons. (The number of colons indicates to which grammar the production belongs.) One or more alternative right-hand sides for the nonterminal then follow on succeeding lines. For example, the syntactic definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        WhileStatement :
          `while` `(` Expression `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>states that the nonterminal |WhileStatement| represents the token `while`, followed by a left parenthesis token, followed by an |Expression|, followed by a right parenthesis token, followed by a |Statement|. The occurrences of |Expression| and |Statement| are themselves nonterminals. As another example, the syntactic definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        ArgumentList :
          AssignmentExpression
          ArgumentList `,` AssignmentExpression
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>states that an |ArgumentList| may represent either a single |AssignmentExpression| or an |ArgumentList|, followed by a comma, followed by an |AssignmentExpression|. This definition of |ArgumentList| is recursive, that is, it is defined in terms of itself. The result is that an |ArgumentList| may contain any positive number of arguments, separated by commas, where each argument expression is an |AssignmentExpression|. Such recursive definitions of nonterminals are common.</p>
      <p>The subscripted suffix &ldquo;<sub>opt</sub>&rdquo;, which may appear after a terminal or nonterminal, indicates an optional symbol. The alternative containing the optional symbol actually specifies two right-hand sides, one that omits the optional element and one that includes it. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer?
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier
          BindingIdentifier Initializer
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        ForStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression? `;` Expression? `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        ForStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` Expression? `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` Expression? `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>which in turn is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        ForStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` Expression `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` Expression `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>so, in this example, the nonterminal |ForStatement| actually has four alternative right-hand sides.</p>
      <p>A production may be parameterized by a subscripted annotation of the form &ldquo;<sub>[parameters]</sub>&rdquo;, which may appear as a suffix to the nonterminal symbol defined by the production. &ldquo;<sub>parameters</sub>&rdquo; may be either a single name or a comma separated list of names. A parameterized production is shorthand for a set of productions defining all combinations of the parameter names, preceded by an underscore, appended to the parameterized nonterminal symbol. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList[Return] :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>

        StatementList_Return :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>

        StatementList_Return_In :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>Multiple parameters produce a combinatory number of productions, not all of which are necessarily referenced in a complete grammar.</p>
      <p>References to nonterminals on the right-hand side of a production can also be parameterized. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement[+In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is equivalent to saying:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement[~In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is equivalent to:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>A nonterminal reference may have both a parameter list and an &ldquo;<sub>opt</sub>&rdquo; suffix. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer[+In]?
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier
          BindingIdentifier Initializer_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>Prefixing a parameter name with &ldquo;<sub>?</sub>&rdquo; on a right-hand side nonterminal reference makes that parameter value dependent upon the occurrence of the parameter name on the reference to the current production's left-hand side symbol. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        VariableDeclaration[In] :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer[?In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer

        VariableDeclaration_In :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>If a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with &ldquo;[+parameter]&rdquo; that alternative is only available if the named parameter was used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol. If a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with &ldquo;[\~parameter]&rdquo; that alternative is only available if the named parameter was <em>not</em> used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList[Return] :
          [+Return] ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        StatementList[Return] :
          [~Return] ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>When the words &ldquo;<b>one of</b>&rdquo; follow the colon(s) in a grammar definition, they signify that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or lines is an alternative definition. For example, the lexical grammar for ECMAScript contains the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        NonZeroDigit :: one of
          `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>which is merely a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        NonZeroDigit ::
          `1`
          `2`
          `3`
          `4`
          `5`
          `6`
          `7`
          `8`
          `9`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[empty]&rdquo; appears as the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production's right-hand side contains no terminals or nonterminals.</p>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead = _seq_]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production may only be used if the token sequence _seq_ is a prefix of the immediately following input token sequence. Similarly, &ldquo;[lookahead &isin; _set_]&rdquo;, where _set_ is a finite nonempty set of token sequences, indicates that the production may only be used if some element of _set_ is a prefix of the immediately following token sequence. For convenience, the set can also be written as a nonterminal, in which case it represents the set of all token sequences to which that nonterminal could expand. It is considered an editorial error if the nonterminal could expand to infinitely many distinct token sequences.</p>
      <p>These conditions may be negated. &ldquo;[lookahead &ne; _seq_]&rdquo; indicates that the containing production may only be used if _seq_ is <em>not</em> a prefix of the immediately following input token sequence, and &ldquo;[lookahead &notin; _set_]&rdquo; indicates that the production may only be used if <em>no</em> element of _set_ is a prefix of the immediately following token sequence.</p>
      <p>As an example, given the definitions:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        DecimalDigit :: one of
          `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`

        DecimalDigits ::
          DecimalDigit
          DecimalDigits DecimalDigit
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>the definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        LookaheadExample ::
          `n` [lookahead &notin; { `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `9` }] DecimalDigits
          DecimalDigit [lookahead &notin; DecimalDigit]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>matches either the letter `n` followed by one or more decimal digits the first of which is even, or a decimal digit not followed by another decimal digit.</p>
      <p>Note that when these phrases are used in the syntactic grammar, it may not be possible to unambiguously identify the immediately following token sequence because determining later tokens requires knowing which lexical goal symbol to use at later positions. As such, when these are used in the syntactic grammar, it is considered an editorial error for a token sequence _seq_ to appear in a lookahead restriction (including as part of a set of sequences) if the choices of lexical goal symbols to use could change whether or not _seq_ would be a prefix of the resulting token sequence.</p>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[no |LineTerminator| here]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production of the syntactic grammar, it indicates that the production is <em>a restricted production</em>: it may not be used if a |LineTerminator| occurs in the input stream at the indicated position. For example, the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        ThrowStatement :
          `throw` [no LineTerminator here] Expression `;`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>indicates that the production may not be used if a |LineTerminator| occurs in the script between the `throw` token and the |Expression|.</p>
      <p>Unless the presence of a |LineTerminator| is forbidden by a restricted production, any number of occurrences of |LineTerminator| may appear between any two consecutive tokens in the stream of input elements without affecting the syntactic acceptability of the script.</p>
      <p>The right-hand side of a production may specify that certain expansions are not permitted by using the phrase &ldquo;<b>but not</b>&rdquo; and then indicating the expansions to be excluded. For example, the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        Identifier ::
          IdentifierName but not ReservedWord
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>means that the nonterminal |Identifier| may be replaced by any sequence of code points that could replace |IdentifierName| provided that the same sequence of code points could not replace |ReservedWord|.</p>
      <p>Finally, a few nonterminal symbols are described by a descriptive phrase in sans-serif type in cases where it would be impractical to list all the alternatives:</p>
      <emu-grammar type="definition" example>
        SourceCharacter ::
          &gt; any Unicode code point
      </emu-grammar>
    </emu-clause>
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="sec-algorithm-conventions">
    <h1>Algorithm Conventions</h1>
    <p>The specification often uses a numbered list to specify steps in an algorithm. These algorithms are used to precisely specify the required semantics of ECMAScript language constructs. The algorithms are not intended to imply the use of any specific implementation technique. In practice, there may be more efficient algorithms available to implement a given feature.</p>
    <p>Algorithms may be explicitly parameterized with an ordered, comma-separated sequence of alias names which may be used within the algorithm steps to reference the argument passed in that position. Optional parameters are denoted with surrounding brackets ([ , _name_ ]) and are no different from required parameters within algorithm steps. A rest parameter may appear at the end of a parameter list, denoted with leading ellipsis (, ..._name_). The rest parameter captures all of the arguments provided following the required and optional parameters into a List. If there are no such additional arguments, that List is empty.</p>
    <p>Algorithm steps may be subdivided into sequential substeps. Substeps are indented and may themselves be further divided into indented substeps. Outline numbering conventions are used to identify substeps with the first level of substeps labelled with lowercase alphabetic characters and the second level of substeps labelled with lowercase roman numerals. If more than three levels are required these rules repeat with the fourth level using numeric labels. For example:</p>
    <emu-alg example>
      1. Top-level step
        1. Substep.
        1. Substep.
          1. Subsubstep.
            1. Subsubsubstep
              1. Subsubsubsubstep
                1. Subsubsubsubsubstep
    </emu-alg>
    <p>A step or substep may be written as an &ldquo;if&rdquo; predicate that conditions its substeps. In this case, the substeps are only applied if the predicate is true. If a step or substep begins with the word &ldquo;else&rdquo;, it is a predicate that is the negation of the preceding &ldquo;if&rdquo; predicate step at the same level.</p>
    <p>A step may specify the iterative application of its substeps.</p>
    <p>A step that begins with &ldquo;<dfn id="assert">Assert</dfn>:&rdquo; asserts an invariant condition of its algorithm. Such assertions are used to make explicit algorithmic invariants that would otherwise be implicit. Such assertions add no additional semantic requirements and hence need not be checked by an implementation. They are used simply to clarify algorithms.</p>
    <p>Algorithm steps may declare named aliases for any value using the form &ldquo;Let _x_ be _someValue_&rdquo;. These aliases are reference-like in that both _x_ and _someValue_ refer to the same underlying data and modifications to either are visible to both. Algorithm steps that want to avoid this reference-like behaviour should explicitly make a copy of the right-hand side: &ldquo;Let _x_ be a copy of _someValue_&rdquo; creates a shallow copy of _someValue_.</p>
    <p>Once declared, an alias may be referenced in any subsequent steps and must not be referenced from steps prior to the alias's declaration. Aliases may be modified using the form &ldquo;Set _x_ to _someOtherValue_&rdquo;.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-algorithm-conventions-abstract-operations">
      <h1>Abstract Operations</h1>
      <p>In order to facilitate their use in multiple parts of this specification, some algorithms, called <dfn>abstract operations</dfn>, are named and written in parameterized functional form so that they may be referenced by name from within other algorithms. Abstract operations are typically referenced using a functional application style such as OperationName(_arg1_, _arg2_). Some abstract operations are treated as polymorphically dispatched methods of class-like specification abstractions. Such method-like abstract operations are typically referenced using a method application style such as _someValue_.OperationName(_arg1_, _arg2_).</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-algorithm-conventions-syntax-directed-operations" namespace="algorithm-conventions">
      <h1>Syntax-Directed Operations</h1>
      <p>A <dfn variants="syntax-directed operations">syntax-directed operation</dfn> is a named operation whose definition consists of algorithms, each of which is associated with one or more productions from one of the ECMAScript grammars. A production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have a distinct algorithm for each alternative. When an algorithm is associated with a grammar production, it may reference the terminal and nonterminal symbols of the production alternative as if they were parameters of the algorithm. When used in this manner, nonterminal symbols refer to the actual alternative definition that is matched when parsing the source text. The <dfn>source text matched by</dfn> a grammar production or Parse Node derived from it is the portion of the source text that starts at the beginning of the first terminal that participated in the match and ends at the end of the last terminal that participated in the match.</p>
      <p>When an algorithm is associated with a production alternative, the alternative is typically shown without any &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo; grammar annotations. Such annotations should only affect the syntactic recognition of the alternative and have no effect on the associated semantics for the alternative.</p>
      <p>Syntax-directed operations are invoked with a parse node and, optionally, other parameters by using the conventions on steps <emu-xref href="#step-sdo-invocation-example-1"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#step-sdo-invocation-example-2"></emu-xref>, and <emu-xref href="#step-sdo-invocation-example-3"></emu-xref> in the following algorithm:</p>
      <emu-alg example>
        1. [id="step-sdo-invocation-example-1"] Let _status_ be SyntaxDirectedOperation of |SomeNonTerminal|.
        1. Let _someParseNode_ be the parse of some source text.
        1. [id="step-sdo-invocation-example-2"] Perform SyntaxDirectedOperation of _someParseNode_.
        1. [id="step-sdo-invocation-example-3"] Perform SyntaxDirectedOperation of _someParseNode_ with argument *"value"*.
      </emu-alg>
      <p>Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all chain productions have an implicit definition for every operation that might be applied to that production's left-hand side nonterminal. The implicit definition simply reapplies the same operation with the same parameters, if any, to the chain production's sole right-hand side nonterminal and then returns the result. For example, assume that some algorithm has a step of the form: &ldquo;Return the result of evaluating |Block|&rdquo; and that there is a production:</p>
      <emu-grammar example>
        Block :
          `{` StatementList `}`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>but the Evaluation operation does not associate an algorithm with that production. In that case, the Evaluation operation implicitly includes an association of the form:</p>
      <p><b>Runtime Semantics: Evaluation</b></p>
      <emu-grammar example>Block : `{` StatementList `}`</emu-grammar>

      <p>Context-free grammars are not sufficiently powerful to express all the rules that define whether a stream of input elements form a valid ECMAScript |Script| or |Module| that may be evaluated. In some situations additional rules are needed that may be expressed using either ECMAScript algorithm conventions or prose requirements. Such rules are always associated with a production of a grammar and are called the <dfn>static semantics</dfn> of the production.</p>
      <p>Static Semantic Rules have names and typically are defined using an algorithm. Named Static Semantic Rules are associated with grammar productions and a production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have for each alternative a distinct algorithm for each applicable named static semantic rule.</p>
      <p>A special kind of static semantic rule is an <dfn id="early-error-rule">Early Error Rule</dfn>. Early error rules define early error conditions (see clause <emu-xref href="#sec-error-handling-and-language-extensions"></emu-xref>) that are associated with specific grammar productions. Evaluation of most early error rules are not explicitly invoked within the algorithms of this specification. A conforming implementation must, prior to the first evaluation of a |Script| or |Module|, validate all of the early error rules of the productions used to parse that |Script| or |Module|.

      <h1>Mathematical Operations</h1>
      <p>This specification makes reference to these kinds of numeric values:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Mathematical values</em>: Arbitrary real numbers, used as the default numeric type.</li>
        <li><em>Extended mathematical values</em>: Mathematical values together with +&infin; and -&infin;.</li>
        <li><em>Numbers</em>: IEEE 754-2019 double-precision floating point values.</li>
        <li><em>BigInts</em>: ECMAScript language values representing arbitrary integers in a one-to-one correspondence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the language of this specification, numerical values are distinguished among different numeric kinds using subscript suffixes. The subscript <sub>𝔽</sub> refers to Numbers, and the subscript <sub>ℤ</sub> refers to BigInts. Numeric values without a subscript suffix refer to mathematical values.</p>
      <p>Numeric operators such as +, &times;, =, and &ge; refer to those operations as determined by the type of the operands. When applied to mathematical values, the operators refer to the usual mathematical operations. When applied to extended mathematical values, the operators refer to the usual mathematical operations over the extended real numbers; indeterminate forms are not defined and their use in this specification should be considered an editorial error. When applied to Numbers, the operators refer to the relevant operations within IEEE 754-2019. When applied to BigInts, the operators refer to the usual mathematical operations applied to the mathematical value of the BigInt.</p>
      <p>In general, when this specification refers to a numerical value, such as in the phrase, "the length of _y_" or "the integer represented by the four hexadecimal digits ...", without explicitly specifying a numeric kind, the phrase refers to a mathematical value. Phrases which refer to a Number or a BigInt value are explicitly annotated as such; for example, "the Number value for the number of code points in &hellip;" or "the BigInt value for &hellip;".</p>
      <p>Numeric operators applied to mixed-type operands (such as a Number and a mathematical value) are not defined and should be considered an editorial error in this specification.</p>
      <p>This specification denotes most numeric values in base 10; it also uses numeric values of the form 0x followed by digits 0-9 or A-F as base-16 values.</p>
      <p>When the term <dfn id="integer" oldids="mathematical integer" variants="integers">integer</dfn> is used in this specification, it refers to a mathematical value which is in the set of integers, unless otherwise stated. When the term <dfn id="integral-number" variants="integral Numbers">integral Number</dfn> is used in this specification, it refers to a Number value whose mathematical value is in the set of integers.</p>
      <p>Conversions between mathematical values and Numbers or BigInts are always explicit in this document. A conversion from a mathematical value or extended mathematical value _x_ to a Number is denoted as "the Number value for _x_" or <dfn id="𝔽">𝔽</dfn>(_x_), and is defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type"></emu-xref>. A conversion from an integer _x_ to a BigInt is denoted as "the BigInt value for _x_" or <dfn id="ℤ">ℤ</dfn>(_x_). A conversion from a Number or BigInt _x_ to a mathematical value is denoted as "the <dfn id="mathematical-value">mathematical value</dfn> of _x_", or <dfn id="ℝ">ℝ</dfn>(_x_). The mathematical value of *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> and *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub> is the mathematical value 0. The mathematical value of non-finite values is not defined. The <dfn id="extended-mathematical-value">extended mathematical value</dfn> of _x_ is the mathematical value of _x_ for finite values, and is +&infin; and -&infin; for *+&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub> and *-&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub> respectively; it is not defined for *NaN*.</p>
      <p>The mathematical function <emu-eqn id="eqn-abs" aoid="abs">abs(_x_)</emu-eqn> produces the absolute value of _x_, which is <emu-eqn>-_x_</emu-eqn> if _x_ &lt; 0 and otherwise is _x_ itself.</p>
      <p>The mathematical function <emu-eqn id="eqn-min" aoid="min">min(_x1_, _x2_, &hellip; , _xN_)</emu-eqn> produces the mathematically smallest of <emu-eqn>_x1_</emu-eqn> through <emu-eqn>_xN_</emu-eqn>. The mathematical function <emu-eqn id="eqn-max" aoid="max">max(_x1_, _x2_, ..., _xN_)</emu-eqn> produces the mathematically largest of <emu-eqn>_x1_</emu-eqn> through <emu-eqn>_xN_</emu-eqn>. The domain and range of these mathematical functions are the extended mathematical values.</p>
      <p>The notation &ldquo;<emu-eqn id="eqn-modulo" aoid="modulo">_x_ modulo _y_</emu-eqn>&rdquo; (_y_ must be finite and non-zero) computes a value _k_ of the same sign as _y_ (or zero) such that <emu-eqn>abs(_k_) &lt; abs(_y_) and _x_ - _k_ = _q_ &times; _y_</emu-eqn> for some integer _q_.</p>
      <p>The phrase "the result of <dfn id="clamping">clamping</dfn> _x_ between _lower_ and _upper_" (where _x_ is an extended mathematical value and _lower_ and _upper_ are mathematical values such that _lower_ &le; _upper_) produces _lower_ if _x_ &lt; _lower_, produces _upper_ if _x_ &gt; _upper_, and otherwise produces _x_.</p>

  <p>Algorithms within this specification manipulate values each of which has an associated type. The possible value types are exactly those defined in this clause. Types are further subclassified into ECMAScript language types and specification types.</p>
  <p>Within this specification, the notation &ldquo;Type(_x_)&rdquo; is used as shorthand for &ldquo;the <em>type</em> of _x_&rdquo; where &ldquo;type&rdquo; refers to the ECMAScript language and specification types defined in this clause.

    <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">
      <h1>The String Type</h1>
      <p>The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values (&ldquo;elements&rdquo;) up to a maximum length of 2<sup>53</sup> - 1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within the sequence. These positions are indexed with non-negative integers. The first element (if any) is at index 0, the next element (if any) at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements (i.e., 16-bit values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore contains no elements.</p>
      <p>ECMAScript operations that do not interpret String contents apply no further semantics. Operations that do interpret String values treat each element as a single UTF-16 code unit. However, ECMAScript does not restrict the value of or relationships between these code units, so operations that further interpret String contents as sequences of Unicode code points encoded in UTF-16 must account for ill-formed subsequences. Such operations apply special treatment to every code unit with a numeric value in the inclusive range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF (defined by the Unicode Standard as a <dfn id="leading-surrogate" variants="leading surrogates">leading surrogate</dfn>, or more formally as a <dfn id="high-surrogate-code-unit" variants="high-surrogate code units">high-surrogate code unit</dfn>) and every code unit with a numeric value in the inclusive range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF (defined as a <dfn id="trailing-surrogate" variants="trailing surrogates">trailing surrogate</dfn>, or more formally as a <dfn id="low-surrogate-code-unit" variants="low-surrogate code units">low-surrogate code unit</dfn>) using the following rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A code unit that is not a <emu-xref href="#leading-surrogate"></emu-xref> and not a <emu-xref href="#trailing-surrogate"></emu-xref> is interpreted as a code point with the same value.
        </li>
        <li>
          A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit _c1_ is a <emu-xref href="#leading-surrogate"></emu-xref> and the second code unit _c2_ a <emu-xref href="#trailing-surrogate"></emu-xref>, is a <dfn id="surrogate-pair" variants="surrogate pairs">surrogate pair</dfn> and is interpreted as a code point with the value (_c1_ - 0xD800) &times; 0x400 + (_c2_ - 0xDC00) + 0x10000. (See <emu-xref href="#sec-utf16decodesurrogatepair"></emu-xref>)
        </li>
        <li>
          A code unit that is a <emu-xref href="#leading-surrogate"></emu-xref> or <emu-xref href="#trailing-surrogate"></emu-xref>, but is not part of a <emu-xref href="#surrogate-pair"></emu-xref>, is interpreted as a code point with the same value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The function `String.prototype.normalize` (see <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.normalize"></emu-xref>) can be used to explicitly normalize a String value. `String.prototype.localeCompare` (see <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.localecompare"></emu-xref>) internally normalizes String values, but no other operations implicitly normalize the strings upon which they operate. Only operations that are explicitly specified to be language or locale sensitive produce language-sensitive results.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of Strings as simple and high-performing as possible. If ECMAScript source text is in Normalized Form C, string literals are guaranteed to also be normalized, as long as they do not contain any Unicode escape sequences.</p>

      <p>In this specification, the phrase "the <dfn id="string-concatenation">string-concatenation</dfn> of _A_, _B_, ..." (where each argument is a String value, a code unit, or a sequence of code units) denotes the String value whose sequence of code units is the concatenation of the code units (in order) of each of the arguments (in order).</p>
      <p>The phrase "the <dfn id="substring">substring</dfn> of _S_ from _inclusiveStart_ to _exclusiveEnd_" (where _S_ is a String value or a sequence of code units and _inclusiveStart_ and _exclusiveEnd_ are integers) denotes the String value consisting of the consecutive code units of _S_ beginning at index _inclusiveStart_ and ending immediately before index _exclusiveEnd_ (which is the empty String when _inclusiveStart_ = _exclusiveEnd_). If the "to" suffix is omitted, the length of _S_ is used as the value of _exclusiveEnd_.</p>

      <p>Because the numeric types are in general not convertible without loss of precision or truncation, the ECMAScript language provides no implicit conversion among these types. Programmers must explicitly call `Number` and `BigInt` functions to convert among types when calling a function which requires another type.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The first and subsequent editions of ECMAScript have provided, for certain operators, implicit numeric conversions that could lose precision or truncate. These legacy implicit conversions are maintained for backward compatibility, but not provided for BigInt in order to minimize opportunity for programmer error, and to leave open the option of generalized <em>value types</em> in a future edition.</p>

        <h1>The Number Type</h1>
        <p>The Number type has exactly 18,437,736,874,454,810,627 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup> - 2<sup>53</sup> + 3</emu-eqn>) values, representing the double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754-2019 values as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the 9,007,199,254,740,990 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>53</sup> - 2</emu-eqn>) distinct &ldquo;Not-a-Number&rdquo; values of the IEEE Standard are represented in ECMAScript as a single special *NaN* value. (Note that the *NaN* value is produced by the program expression `NaN`.) In some implementations, external code might be able to detect a difference between various Not-a-Number values, but such behaviour is implementation-defined; to ECMAScript code, all *NaN* values are indistinguishable from each other.</p>
        <emu-note>
          <p>The bit pattern that might be observed in an ArrayBuffer (see <emu-xref href="#sec-arraybuffer-objects"></emu-xref>) or a SharedArrayBuffer (see <emu-xref href="#sec-sharedarraybuffer-objects"></emu-xref>) after a Number value has been stored into it is not necessarily the same as the internal representation of that Number value used by the ECMAScript implementation.</p>
        </emu-note>
        <p>There are two other special values, called *positive Infinity* and *negative Infinity*. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols *+&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub> and *-&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub>, respectively. (Note that these two infinite Number values are produced by the program expressions `+Infinity` (or simply `Infinity`) and `-Infinity`.)</p>
        <p>The other 18,437,736,874,454,810,624 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup> - 2<sup>53</sup></emu-eqn>) values are called the finite numbers. Half of these are positive numbers and half are negative numbers; for every finite positive Number value there is a corresponding negative value having the same magnitude.</p>
        <p>Note that there is both a *positive zero* and a *negative zero*. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> and *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub>, respectively. (Note that these two different zero Number values are produced by the program expressions `+0` (or simply `0`) and `-0`.)</p>
        <p>The 18,437,736,874,454,810,622 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup> - 2<sup>53</sup> - 2</emu-eqn>) finite non-zero values are of two kinds:</p>
        <p>18,428,729,675,200,069,632 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup> - 2<sup>54</sup></emu-eqn>) of them are normalized, having the form</p>
        <div class="math-display">
          _s_ &times; _m_ &times; 2<sup>_e_</sup>
        </div>
        <p>where _s_ is 1 or -1, _m_ is an integer such that 2<sup>52</sup> &le; _m_ &lt; 2<sup>53</sup>, and _e_ is an integer such that -1074 &le; _e_ &le; 971.</p>
        <p>The remaining 9,007,199,254,740,990 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>53</sup> - 2</emu-eqn>) values are denormalized, having the form</p>
        <div class="math-display">
          _s_ &times; _m_ &times; 2<sup>_e_</sup>
        </div>
        <p>where _s_ is 1 or -1, _m_ is an integer such that 0 &lt; _m_ &lt; 2<sup>52</sup>, and _e_ is -1074.</p>
        <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are representable in the Number type. The integer 0 has two representations in the Number type: *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> and *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub>.</p>
        <p>A finite number has an <em>odd significand</em> if it is non-zero and the integer _m_ used to express it (in one of the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise, it has an <em>even significand</em>.</p>
        <p>In this specification, the phrase &ldquo;the <dfn id="number-value">Number value</dfn> for _x_&rdquo; where _x_ represents an exact real mathematical quantity (which might even be an irrational number such as &pi;) means a Number value chosen in the following manner. Consider the set of all finite values of the Number type, with *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub> removed and with two additional values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely 2<sup>1024</sup> (which is <emu-eqn>+1 &times; 2<sup>53</sup> &times; 2<sup>971</sup></emu-eqn>) and <emu-eqn>-2<sup>1024</sup></emu-eqn> (which is <emu-eqn>-1 &times; 2<sup>53</sup> &times; 2<sup>971</sup></emu-eqn>). Choose the member of this set that is closest in value to _x_. If two values of the set are equally close, then the one with an even significand is chosen; for this purpose, the two extra values 2<sup>1024</sup> and <emu-eqn>-2<sup>1024</sup></emu-eqn> are considered to have even significands. Finally, if 2<sup>1024</sup> was chosen, replace it with *+&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub>; if <emu-eqn>-2<sup>1024</sup></emu-eqn> was chosen, replace it with *-&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub>; if *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> was chosen, replace it with *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub> if and only if _x_ &lt; 0; any other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is the Number value for _x_. (This procedure corresponds exactly to the behaviour of the IEEE 754-2019 roundTiesToEven mode.)</p>
        <p>The Number value for +&infin; is *+&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub>, and the Number value for -&infin; is *-&infin;*<sub>𝔽</sub>.</p>
        <p>Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in specific ranges such as <emu-eqn>-2<sup>31</sup></emu-eqn> through <emu-eqn>2<sup>31</sup> - 1</emu-eqn>, inclusive, or in the range 0 through <emu-eqn>2<sup>16</sup> - 1</emu-eqn>, inclusive. These operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each such value to an integer value in the expected range.

The IEEE 754-2019 &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; operation computes the remainder from a rounding division, not a truncating division, and so its behaviour is not analogous to that of the usual <emu-not-ref>integer</emu-not-ref> remainder operator. Instead the ECMAScript language defines `%` on floating-point operations to behave in a manner analogous to that of the Java <emu-not-ref>integer</emu-not-ref> remainder operator; this may be compared with the C library function fmod.</emu-note>

      <h1>The Object Type</h1>
      <p>An Object is logically a collection of properties. Each property is either a data property, or an accessor property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <dfn variants="data properties">data property</dfn> associates a key value with an ECMAScript language value and a set of Boolean attributes.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <dfn variants="accessor properties">accessor property</dfn> associates a key value with one or two accessor functions, and a set of Boolean attributes. The accessor functions are used to store or retrieve an ECMAScript language value that is associated with the property.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Properties are identified using key values. A <dfn variants="property keys">property key</dfn> value is either an ECMAScript String value or a Symbol value. All String and Symbol values, including the empty String, are valid as property keys. A <dfn id="property-name">property name</dfn> is a property key that is a String value.</p>
      <p>An <dfn id="integer-index" variants="integer indices">integer index</dfn> is a String-valued property key that is a canonical numeric String (see <emu-xref href="#sec-canonicalnumericindexstring"></emu-xref>) and whose numeric value is either *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> or a positive integral Number &le; 𝔽(2<sup>53</sup> - 1). An <dfn id="array-index" variants="array indices">array index</dfn> is an integer index whose numeric value _i_ is in the range <emu-eqn>*+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> &le; _i_ &lt; 𝔽(2<sup>32</sup> - 1)</emu-eqn>.</p>
      <p>Property keys are used to access properties and their values. There are two kinds of access for properties: <em>get</em> and <em>set</em>, corresponding to value retrieval and assignment, respectively. The properties accessible via get and set access includes both <em>own properties</em> that are a direct part of an object and <em>inherited properties</em> which are provided by another associated object via a property inheritance relationship. Inherited properties may be either own or inherited properties of the associated object. Each own property of an object must each have a key value that is distinct from the key values of the other own properties of that object.</p>
      <p>All objects are logically collections of properties, but there are multiple forms of objects that differ in their semantics for accessing and manipulating their properties. Please see <emu-xref href="#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref> for definitions of the multiple forms of objects.</p>

      <emu-clause id="sec-property-attributes">
        <h1>Property Attributes</h1>

        <h1>Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots</h1>
        <p>The actual semantics of objects, in ECMAScript, are specified via algorithms called <em>internal methods</em>. Each object in an ECMAScript engine is associated with a set of internal methods that defines its runtime behaviour. These internal methods are not part of the ECMAScript language. They are defined by this specification purely for expository purposes. However, each object within an implementation of ECMAScript must behave as specified by the internal methods associated with it. The exact manner in which this is accomplished is determined by the implementation.</p>
        <p>Internal method names are polymorphic. This means that different object values may perform different algorithms when a common internal method name is invoked upon them. That actual object upon which an internal method is invoked is the &ldquo;target&rdquo; of the invocation. If, at runtime, the implementation of an algorithm attempts to use an internal method of an object that the object does not support, a *TypeError* exception is thrown.</p>
        <p>Internal slots correspond to internal state that is associated with objects and used by various ECMAScript specification algorithms. Internal slots are not object properties and they are not inherited. Depending upon the specific internal slot specification, such state may consist of values of any ECMAScript language type or of specific ECMAScript specification type values. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, internal slots are allocated as part of the process of creating an object and may not be dynamically added to an object. Unless specified otherwise, the initial value of an internal slot is the value *undefined*. Various algorithms within this specification create objects that have internal slots. However, the ECMAScript language provides no direct way to associate internal slots with an object.</p>
        <p>All objects have an internal slot named [[PrivateElements]], which is a List of PrivateElements. This List represents the values of the private fields, methods, and accessors for the object. Initially, it is an empty List.</p>
        <p>Internal methods and internal slots are identified within this specification using names enclosed in double square brackets [[ ]].</p>
        <p><emu-xref href="#table-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref> summarizes the <em>essential internal methods</em> used by this specification that are applicable to all objects created or manipulated by ECMAScript code. Every object must have algorithms for all of the essential internal methods. However, all objects do not necessarily use the same algorithms for those methods.</p>
        <p>An <dfn id="ordinary-object" variants="ordinary objects">ordinary object</dfn> is an object that satisfies all of the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the internal methods listed in <emu-xref href="#table-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref>, the object uses those defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the object has a [[Call]] internal method, it uses the one defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist"></emu-xref>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the object has a [[Construct]] internal method, it uses the one defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-construct-argumentslist-newtarget"></emu-xref>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An <dfn id="exotic-object" variants="exotic objects">exotic object</dfn> is an object that is not an ordinary object.</p>
        <p>This specification recognizes different kinds of exotic objects by those objects' internal methods. An object that is behaviourally equivalent to a particular kind of exotic object (such as an Array exotic object or a bound function exotic object), but does not have the same collection of internal methods specified for that kind, is not recognized as that kind of exotic object.</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;Signature&rdquo; column of <emu-xref href="#table-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref> and other similar tables describes the invocation pattern for each internal method. The invocation pattern always includes a parenthesized list of descriptive parameter names. If a parameter name is the same as an ECMAScript type name then the name describes the required type of the parameter value. If an internal method explicitly returns a value, its parameter list is followed by the symbol &ldquo;&rarr;&rdquo; and the type name of the returned value. The type names used in signatures refer to the types defined in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values"></emu-xref> augmented by the following additional names. &ldquo;<em>any</em>&rdquo; means the value may be any ECMAScript language type.</p>
        <p>In addition to its parameters, an internal method always has access to the object that is the target of the method invocation.</p>
        <p>An internal method implicitly returns a Completion Record, either a normal completion that wraps a value of the return type shown in its invocation pattern, or a throw completion.</p>

          <li>
            The normal return type is either Object or Null.

          <li>
            If target is non-extensible, and [[GetPrototypeOf]] returns a value _V_, then any future calls to [[GetPrototypeOf]] should return the SameValue as _V_.

          <p>An object's prototype chain should have finite length (that is, starting from any object, recursively applying the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal method to its result should eventually lead to the value *null*). However, this requirement is not enforceable as an object level invariant if the prototype chain includes any exotic objects that do not use the ordinary object definition of [[GetPrototypeOf]]. Such a circular prototype chain may result in infinite loops when accessing object properties.</p>

            If _P_ is described as a non-configurable, non-writable own data property, all future calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] ( _P_ ) must return Property Descriptor whose [[Value]] is SameValue as _P_'s [[Value]] attribute.
          </li>
          <li>
            If _P_'s attributes other than [[Writable]] may change over time or if the property might be deleted, then _P_'s [[Configurable]] attribute must be *true*.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the [[Writable]] attribute may change from *false* to *true*, then the [[Configurable]] attribute must be *true*.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the target is non-extensible and _P_ is non-existent, then all future calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] (_P_) on the target must describe _P_ as non-existent (i.e. [[GetOwnProperty]] (_P_) must return *undefined*).

        <emu-note>
          <p>As a consequence of the third invariant, if a property is described as a data property and it may return different values over time, then either or both of the [[Writable]] and [[Configurable]] attributes must be *true* even if no mechanism to change the value is exposed via the other essential internal methods.</p>

                _P_ is a writable data property. A non-configurable writable data property can be changed into a non-configurable non-writable data property.

  <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-specification-types">
    <h1>ECMAScript Specification Types</h1>
    <p>A specification type corresponds to meta-values that are used within algorithms to describe the semantics of ECMAScript language constructs and ECMAScript language types. The specification types include Reference, List, Completion, Property Descriptor, Environment Record, Abstract Closure, and Data Block. Specification type values are specification artefacts that do not necessarily correspond to any specific entity within an ECMAScript implementation. Specification type values may be used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression evaluation but such values cannot be stored as properties of objects or values of ECMAScript language variables.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-list-and-record-specification-type">
      <h1>The List and Record Specification Types</h1>
      <p>The <dfn variants="Lists">List</dfn> type is used to explain the evaluation of argument lists (see <emu-xref href="#sec-argument-lists"></emu-xref>) in `new` expressions, in function calls, and in other algorithms where a simple ordered list of values is needed. Values of the List type are simply ordered sequences of list elements containing the individual values. These sequences may be of any length. The elements of a list may be randomly accessed using 0-origin indices. For notational convenience an array-like syntax can be used to access List elements. For example, _arguments_[2] is shorthand for saying the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of the List _arguments_.</p>
      <p>When an algorithm iterates over the elements of a List without specifying an order, the order used is the order of the elements in the List.</p>
      <p>For notational convenience within this specification, a literal syntax can be used to express a new List value. For example, &laquo; 1, 2 &raquo; defines a List value that has two elements each of which is initialized to a specific value. A new empty List can be expressed as &laquo; &raquo;.</p>
      <p>In this specification, the phrase "the <dfn id="list-concatenation">list-concatenation</dfn> of _A_, _B_, ..." (where each argument is a possibly empty List) denotes a new List value whose elements are the concatenation of the elements (in order) of each of the arguments (in order).</p>
      <p>The <dfn variants="Records">Record</dfn> type is used to describe data aggregations within the algorithms of this specification. A Record type value consists of one or more named fields. The value of each field is an ECMAScript language value or specification value. Field names are always enclosed in double brackets, for example [[Value]].</p>
      <p>For notational convenience within this specification, an object literal-like syntax can be used to express a Record value. For example, { [[Field1]]: 42, [[Field2]]: *false*, [[Field3]]: ~empty~ } defines a Record value that has three fields, each of which is initialized to a specific value. Field name order is not significant. Any fields that are not explicitly listed are considered to be absent.</p>
      <p>In specification text and algorithms, dot notation may be used to refer to a specific field of a Record value. For example, if R is the record shown in the previous paragraph then R.[[Field2]] is shorthand for &ldquo;the field of R named [[Field2]]&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Schema for commonly used Record field combinations may be named, and that name may be used as a prefix to a literal Record value to identify the specific kind of aggregations that is being described. For example: PropertyDescriptor { [[Value]]: 42, [[Writable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* }.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-set-and-relation-specification-type">
      <h1>The Set and Relation Specification Types</h1>
      <p>The <em>Set</em> type is used to explain a collection of unordered elements for use in the memory model. It is distinct from the ECMAScript collection type of the same name. To disambiguate, instances of the ECMAScript collection are consistently referred to as "Set objects" within this specification. Values of the Set type are simple collections of elements, where no element appears more than once. Elements may be added to and removed from Sets. Sets may be unioned, intersected, or subtracted from each other.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Relation</dfn> type is used to explain constraints on Sets. Values of the Relation type are Sets of ordered pairs of values from its value domain. For example, a Relation on events is a set of ordered pairs of events. For a Relation _R_ and two values _a_ and _b_ in the value domain of _R_, _a_ _R_ _b_ is shorthand for saying the ordered pair (_a_, _b_) is a member of _R_. A Relation is least with respect to some conditions when it is the smallest Relation that satisfies those conditions.</p>
      <p>A <dfn variants="strict partial orders">strict partial order</dfn> is a Relation value _R_ that satisfies the following.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>For all _a_, _b_, and _c_ in _R_'s domain:</p>

          <ul>

      <h1>The Property Descriptor Specification Type</h1>
      <p>The <dfn variants="Property Descriptors">Property Descriptor</dfn> type is used to explain the manipulation and reification of Object property attributes. Values of the Property Descriptor type are Records. Each field's name is an attribute name and its value is a corresponding attribute value as specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-property-attributes"></emu-xref>. In addition, any field may be present or absent. The schema name used within this specification to tag literal descriptions of Property Descriptor records is &ldquo;PropertyDescriptor&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Property Descriptor values may be further classified as data Property Descriptors and accessor Property Descriptors based upon the existence or use of certain fields. A data Property Descriptor is one that includes any fields named either [[Value]] or [[Writable]]. An accessor Property Descriptor is one that includes any fields named either [[Get]] or [[Set]]. Any Property Descriptor may have fields named [[Enumerable]] and [[Configurable]]. A Property Descriptor value may not be both a data Property Descriptor and an accessor Property Descriptor; however, it may be neither (in which case it is a generic Property Descriptor). A <dfn>fully populated Property Descriptor</dfn> is one that is either an accessor Property Descriptor or a data Property Descriptor and that has all of the corresponding fields defined in <emu-xref href="#table-object-property-attributes"></emu-xref>.</p>

In steps that specify the algorithm to be performed when an Abstract Closure is called, each captured value is referred to by the alias that was used to capture the value.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-data-blocks">
      <h1>Data Blocks</h1>
      <p>The <dfn variants="Data Blocks">Data Block</dfn> specification type is used to describe a distinct and mutable sequence of byte-sized (8 bit) numeric values. A <dfn variants="byte values">byte value</dfn> is an integer value in the range 0 through 255, inclusive. A Data Block value is created with a fixed number of bytes that each have the initial value 0.</p>
      <p>For notational convenience within this specification, an array-like syntax can be used to access the individual bytes of a Data Block value. This notation presents a Data Block value as a 0-origined integer-indexed sequence of bytes. For example, if _db_ is a 5 byte Data Block value then _db_[2] can be used to access its 3<sup>rd</sup> byte.</p>
      <p>A data block that resides in memory that can be referenced from multiple agents concurrently is designated a <dfn variants="Shared Data Blocks">Shared Data Block</dfn>. A Shared Data Block has an identity (for the purposes of equality testing Shared Data Block values) that is <em>address-free</em>: it is tied not to the virtual addresses the block is mapped to in any process, but to the set of locations in memory that the block represents. Two data blocks are equal only if the sets of the locations they contain are equal; otherwise, they are not equal and the intersection of the sets of locations they contain is empty. Finally, Shared Data Blocks can be distinguished from Data Blocks.</p>
      <p>The semantics of Shared Data Blocks is defined using Shared Data Block events by the memory model. Abstract operations below introduce Shared Data Block events and act as the interface between evaluation semantics and the event semantics of the memory model. The events form a candidate execution, on which the memory model acts as a filter. Please consult the memory model for full semantics.</p>
      <p>Shared Data Block events are modeled by Records, defined in the memory model.</p>

        <p>When *undefined* is passed for _environment_ it indicates that a PutValue operation should be used to assign the initialization value. This is the case for formal parameter lists of non-strict functions. In that case the formal parameter bindings are preinitialized in order to deal with the possibility of multiple parameters with the same name.</p>

    <h1>Environment Records</h1>
    <p><dfn variants="Environment Records">Environment Record</dfn> is a specification type used to define the association of |Identifier|s to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a |FunctionDeclaration|, a |BlockStatement|, or a |Catch| clause of a |TryStatement|. Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.</p>
    <p>Every Environment Record has an [[OuterEnv]] field, which is either *null* or a reference to an outer Environment Record. This is used to model the logical nesting of Environment Record values. The outer reference of an (inner) Environment Record is a reference to the Environment Record that logically surrounds the inner Environment Record. An outer Environment Record may, of course, have its own outer Environment Record. An Environment Record may serve as the outer environment for multiple inner Environment Records. For example, if a |FunctionDeclaration| contains two nested |FunctionDeclaration|s then the Environment Records of each of the nested functions will have as their outer Environment Record the Environment Record of the current evaluation of the surrounding function.</p>
    <p>Environment Records are purely specification mechanisms and need not correspond to any specific artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for an ECMAScript program to directly access or manipulate such values.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-the-environment-record-type-hierarchy">
      <h1>The Environment Record Type Hierarchy</h1>
      <p>Environment Records can be thought of as existing in a simple object-oriented hierarchy where Environment Record is an abstract class with three concrete subclasses: declarative Environment Record, object Environment Record, and global Environment Record. Function Environment Records and module Environment Records are subclasses of declarative Environment Record.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Environment Record (abstract)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>A <em>declarative Environment Record</em> is used to define the effect of ECMAScript language syntactic elements such as |FunctionDeclaration|s, |VariableDeclaration|s, and |Catch| clauses that directly associate identifier bindings with ECMAScript language values.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>A <em>function Environment Record</em> corresponds to the invocation of an ECMAScript function object, and contains bindings for the top-level declarations within that function. It may establish a new `this` binding. It also captures the state necessary to support `super` method invocations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A <em>module Environment Record</em> contains the bindings for the top-level declarations of a |Module|. It also contains the bindings that are explicitly imported by the |Module|. Its [[OuterEnv]] is a global Environment Record.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>An <em>object Environment Record</em> is used to define the effect of ECMAScript elements such as |WithStatement| that associate identifier bindings with the properties of some object.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A <em>global Environment Record</em> is used for |Script| global declarations. It does not have an outer environment; its [[OuterEnv]] is *null*. It may be prepopulated with identifier bindings and it includes an associated global object whose properties provide some of the global environment's identifier bindings. As ECMAScript code is executed, additional properties may be added to the global object and the initial properties may be modified.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Environment Record abstract class includes the abstract specification methods defined in <emu-xref href="#table-abstract-methods-of-environment-records"></emu-xref>. These abstract methods have distinct concrete algorithms for each of the concrete subclasses.</p>

An object Environment Record binds the set of string identifier names that directly correspond to the property names of its binding object.

Both own and inherited properties are included in the set regardless of the setting of their [[Enumerable]] attribute.

        <h1>Global Environment Records</h1>
        <p>A <dfn variants="global Environment Records">global Environment Record</dfn> is used to represent the outer most scope that is shared by all of the ECMAScript |Script| elements that are processed in a common realm. A global Environment Record provides the bindings for built-in globals (clause <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref>), properties of the global object, and for all top-level declarations (<emu-xref href="#sec-static-semantics-toplevellexicallyscopeddeclarations"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-static-semantics-toplevelvarscopeddeclarations"></emu-xref>) that occur within a |Script|.</p>
        <p>A global Environment Record is logically a single record but it is specified as a composite encapsulating an object Environment Record and a declarative Environment Record. The object Environment Record has as its base object the global object of the associated Realm Record. This global object is the value returned by the global Environment Record's GetThisBinding concrete method. The object Environment Record component of a global Environment Record contains the bindings for all built-in globals (clause <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref>) and all bindings introduced by a |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncGeneratorDeclaration|, or |VariableStatement| contained in global code. The bindings for all other ECMAScript declarations in global code are contained in the declarative Environment Record component of the global Environment Record.</p>
        <p>Properties may be created directly on a global object. Hence, the object Environment Record component of a global Environment Record may contain both bindings created explicitly by |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncGeneratorDeclaration|, or |VariableDeclaration| declarations and bindings created implicitly as properties of the global object. In order to identify which bindings were explicitly created using declarations, a global Environment Record maintains a list of the names bound using its CreateGlobalVarBinding and CreateGlobalFunctionBinding concrete methods.</p>
        <p>Global Environment Records have the additional fields listed in <emu-xref href="#table-additional-fields-of-global-environment-records"></emu-xref> and the additional methods listed in <emu-xref href="#table-additional-methods-of-global-environment-records"></emu-xref>.</p>

    <p>The <dfn id="execution-context-stack" variants="execution context stacks">execution context stack</dfn> is used to track execution contexts. The running execution context is always the top element of this stack.

The newly created execution context is pushed onto the stack and becomes the running execution context.</p>
    <p>An execution context contains whatever implementation specific state is necessary to track the execution progress of its associated code. Each execution context has at least the state components listed in <emu-xref href="#table-state-components-for-all-execution-contexts"></emu-xref>.</p>

    <h1>Jobs and Host Operations to Enqueue Jobs</h1>
    <p>A <dfn id="job" variants="Jobs">Job</dfn> is an Abstract Closure with no parameters that initiates an ECMAScript computation when no other ECMAScript computation is currently in progress.</p>
    <p>Jobs are scheduled for execution by ECMAScript host environments. This specification describes the host hook HostEnqueuePromiseJob to schedule one kind of job; hosts may define additional abstract operations which schedule jobs. Such operations accept a Job Abstract Closure as the parameter and schedule it to be performed at some future time. Their implementations must conform to the following requirements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>At some future point in time, when there is no running execution context and the execution context stack is empty, the implementation must:
        <ol>
          <li>Perform any host-defined preparation steps.</li>
          <li>Invoke the Job Abstract Closure.</li>
          <li>Perform any host-defined cleanup steps, after which the execution context stack must be empty.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Only one Job may be actively undergoing evaluation at any point in time.</li>
      <li>Once evaluation of a Job starts, it must run to completion before evaluation of any other Job starts.</li>
      <li>The Abstract Closure must return a normal completion, implementing its own handling of errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <emu-note>
      Host environments are not required to treat Jobs uniformly with respect to scheduling. For example, web browsers and Node.js treat Promise-handling Jobs as a higher priority than other work; future features may add Jobs that are not treated at such a high priority.
    </emu-note>

    <p>At any particular time, _scriptOrModule_ (a Script Record, a Module Record, or *null*) is the <dfn id="job-activescriptormodule">active script or module</dfn> if all of the following conditions are true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GetActiveScriptOrModule() is _scriptOrModule_.</li>
      <li>If _scriptOrModule_ is a Script Record or Module Record, let _ec_ be the topmost execution context on the execution context stack whose ScriptOrModule component is _scriptOrModule_. The Realm component of _ec_ is _scriptOrModule_.[[Realm]].</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At any particular time, an execution is <dfn id="job-preparedtoevaluatecode">prepared to evaluate ECMAScript code</dfn> if all of the following conditions are true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The execution context stack is not empty.</li>
      <li>The Realm component of the topmost execution context on the execution context stack is a Realm Record.</li>
    </ul>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Host environments may prepare an execution to evaluate code by pushing execution contexts onto the execution context stack. The specific steps are implementation-defined.</p>
      <p>The specific choice of Realm is up to the host environment. This initial execution context and Realm is only in use before any callback function is invoked. When a callback function related to a Job, like a Promise handler, is invoked, the invocation pushes its own execution context and Realm.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Programs within different agents may share memory by unspecified means. At a minimum, the backing memory for SharedArrayBuffers can be shared among the agents in the cluster.</p>

      <p>There may be agents that can communicate by message passing that cannot share memory; they are never in the same agent cluster.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>Every agent belongs to exactly one agent cluster.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The agents in a cluster need not all be alive at some particular point in time. If agent <b>A</b> creates another agent <b>B</b>, after which <b>A</b> terminates and <b>B</b> creates agent <b>C</b>, the three agents are in the same cluster if <b>A</b> could share some memory with <b>B</b> and <b>B</b> could share some memory with <b>C</b>.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same value for the [[LittleEndian]] property in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>If different agents within an agent cluster have different values of [[LittleEndian]] it becomes hard to use shared memory for multi-byte data.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same values for the [[IsLockFree1]] property in their respective Agent Records; similarly for the [[IsLockFree2]] property.</p>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have different values for the [[Signifier]] property in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <p>An embedding may deactivate (stop forward progress) or activate (resume forward progress) an agent without the agent's knowledge or cooperation. If the embedding does so, it must not leave some agents in the cluster active while other agents in the cluster are deactivated indefinitely.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The purpose of the preceding restriction is to avoid a situation where an agent deadlocks or starves because another agent has been deactivated. For example, if an HTML shared worker that has a lifetime independent of documents in any windows were allowed to share memory with the dedicated worker of such an independent document, and the document and its dedicated worker were to be deactivated while the dedicated worker holds a lock (say, the document is pushed into its window's history), and the shared worker then tries to acquire the lock, then the shared worker will be blocked until the dedicated worker is activated again, if ever. Meanwhile other workers trying to access the shared worker from other windows will starve.</p>

      <p>The implication of the restriction is that it will not be possible to share memory between agents that don't belong to the same suspend/wake collective within the embedding.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>An embedding may terminate an agent without any of the agent's cluster's other agents' prior knowledge or cooperation. If an agent is terminated not by programmatic action of its own or of another agent in the cluster but by forces external to the cluster, then the embedding must choose one of two strategies: Either terminate all the agents in the cluster, or provide reliable APIs that allow the agents in the cluster to coordinate so that at least one remaining member of the cluster will be able to detect the termination, with the termination data containing enough information to identify the agent that was terminated.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Examples of that type of termination are: operating systems or users terminating agents that are running in separate processes; the embedding itself terminating an agent that is running in-process with the other agents when per-agent resource accounting indicates that the agent is runaway.</p>

    <p>Prior to any evaluation of any ECMAScript code by any agent in a cluster, the [[CandidateExecution]] field of the Agent Record for all agents in the cluster is set to the initial candidate execution.

  <emu-clause id="sec-forward-progress">
    <h1>Forward Progress</h1>
    <p>For an agent to <em>make forward progress</em> is for it to perform an evaluation step according to this specification.</p>
    <p>An agent becomes <em>blocked</em> when its running execution context waits synchronously and indefinitely for an external event. Only agents whose Agent Record's [[CanBlock]] property is *true* can become blocked in this sense. An <em>unblocked</em> agent is one that is not blocked.</p>

    <p>Implementations must ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>every unblocked agent with a dedicated executing thread eventually makes forward progress</li>
      <li>in a set of agents that share an executing thread, one agent eventually makes forward progress</li>
      <li>an agent does not cause another agent to become blocked except via explicit APIs that provide blocking.</li>

    <h1>Processing Model of WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry Objects</h1>

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-invariants">
      <h1>Objectives</h1>

      <p>This specification does not make any guarantees that any object will be garbage collected. Objects which are not live may be released after long periods of time, or never at all. For this reason, this specification uses the term "may" when describing behaviour triggered by garbage collection.</p>

      <p>The semantics of WeakRefs and FinalizationRegistrys is based on two operations which happen at particular points in time:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When `WeakRef.prototype.deref` is called, the referent (if *undefined* is not returned) is kept alive so that subsequent, synchronous accesses also return the object. This list is reset when synchronous work is done using the ClearKeptObjects abstract operation.
        </li>

        <li>
          When an object which is registered with a FinalizationRegistry becomes unreachable, a call of the FinalizationRegistry's cleanup callback may eventually be made, after synchronous ECMAScript execution completes. The FinalizationRegistry cleanup is performed with the CleanupFinalizationRegistry abstract operation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Neither of these actions (ClearKeptObjects or CleanupFinalizationRegistry) may interrupt synchronous ECMAScript execution. Because hosts may assemble longer, synchronous ECMAScript execution runs, this specification defers the scheduling of ClearKeptObjects and CleanupFinalizationRegistry to the host environment.</p>

      <p>Some ECMAScript implementations include garbage collector implementations which run in the background, including when ECMAScript is idle. Letting the host environment schedule CleanupFinalizationRegistry allows it to resume ECMAScript execution in order to run finalizer work, which may free up held values, reducing overall memory usage.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="sec-liveness">
      <h1>Liveness</h1>

      <p>For some set of objects _S_, a <dfn>hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious</dfn> execution with respect to _S_ is an execution whereby the abstract operation WeakRefDeref of a WeakRef whose referent is an element of _S_ always returns *undefined*.</p>

      <emu-note>
        WeakRef-obliviousness, together with liveness, capture two notions. One, that a WeakRef itself does not keep an object alive. Two, that cycles in liveness does not imply that an object is live. To be concrete, if determining _obj_'s liveness depends on determining the liveness of another WeakRef referent, _obj2_, _obj2_'s liveness cannot assume _obj_'s liveness, which would be circular reasoning.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        WeakRef-obliviousness is defined on sets of objects instead of individual objects to account for cycles. If it were defined on individual objects, then an object in a cycle will be considered live even though its Object value is only observed via WeakRefs of other objects in the cycle.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        Colloquially, we say that an individual object is live if every set of objects containing it is live.
      </emu-note>

      <p>At any point during evaluation, a set of objects _S_ is considered <dfn>live</dfn> if either of the following conditions is met:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Any element in _S_ is included in any agent's [[KeptAlive]] List.
        </li>
        <li>
          There exists a valid future hypothetical WeakRef-oblivious execution with respect to _S_ that observes the Object value of any object in _S_.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <emu-note>
        The second condition above intends to capture the intuition that an object is live if its identity is observable via non-WeakRef means. An object's identity may be observed by observing a strict equality comparison between objects or observing the object being used as key in a Map.
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>Presence of an object in a field, an internal slot, or a property does not imply that the object is live. For example if the object in question is never passed back to the program, then it cannot be observed.</p>

        <p>This is the case for keys in a WeakMap, members of a WeakSet, as well as the [[WeakRefTarget]] and [[UnregisterToken]] fields of a FinalizationRegistry Cell record.</p>

        <p>The above definition implies that, if a key in a WeakMap is not live, then its corresponding value is not necessarily live either.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        Liveness is the lower bound for guaranteeing which WeakRefs engines must not empty. Liveness as defined here is undecidable. In practice, engines use conservative approximations such as reachability. There is expected to be significant implementation leeway.

    <emu-clause id="sec-weakref-execution">
      <h1>Execution</h1>

      <p>At any time, if a set of objects _S_ is not live, an ECMAScript implementation may perform the following steps atomically:</p>

      <emu-alg>
        1. For each element _obj_ of _S_, do
          1. For each WeakRef _ref_ such that _ref_.[[WeakRefTarget]] is _obj_, do
            1. Set _ref_.[[WeakRefTarget]] to ~empty~.
          1. For each FinalizationRegistry _fg_ such that _fg_.[[Cells]] contains a Record _cell_ such that _cell_.[[WeakRefTarget]] is _obj_, do
            1. Set _cell_.[[WeakRefTarget]] to ~empty~.
            1. Optionally, perform HostEnqueueFinalizationRegistryCleanupJob(_fg_).
          1. For each WeakMap _map_ such that _map_.[[WeakMapData]] contains a Record _r_ such that _r_.[[Key]] is _obj_, do
            1. Set _r_.[[Key]] to ~empty~.
            1. Set _r_.[[Value]] to ~empty~.
          1. For each WeakSet _set_ such that _set_.[[WeakSetData]] contains _obj_, do
            1. Replace the element of _set_.[[WeakSetData]] whose value is _obj_ with an element whose value is ~empty~.
      </emu-alg>

      <emu-note>
        <p>Together with the definition of liveness, this clause prescribes legal optimizations that an implementation may apply regarding WeakRefs.</p>

        <p>It is possible to access an object without observing its identity. Optimizations such as dead variable elimination and scalar replacement on properties of non-escaping objects whose identity is not observed are allowed. These optimizations are thus allowed to observably empty WeakRefs that point to such objects.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if an object's identity is observable, and that object is in the [[WeakRefTarget]] internal slot of a WeakRef, optimizations such as rematerialization that observably empty the WeakRef are prohibited.</p>

        <p>Because calling HostEnqueueFinalizationRegistryCleanupJob is optional, registered objects in a FinalizationRegistry do not necessarily hold that FinalizationRegistry live. Implementations may omit FinalizationRegistry callbacks for any reason, e.g., if the FinalizationRegistry itself becomes dead, or if the application is shutting down.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>Implementations are not obligated to empty WeakRefs for maximal sets of non-live objects.</p>
        <p>If an implementation chooses a non-live set _S_ in which to empty WeakRefs, it must empty WeakRefs for all objects in _S_ simultaneously. In other words, an implementation must not empty a WeakRef pointing to an object _obj_ without emptying out other WeakRefs that, if not emptied, could result in an execution that observes the Object value of _obj_.</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">
    <h1>Ordinary Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots</h1>
    <p>All ordinary objects have an internal slot called [[Prototype]]. The value of this internal slot is either *null* or an object and is used for implementing inheritance. Data properties of the [[Prototype]] object are inherited (and visible as properties of the child object) for the purposes of get access, but not for set access. Accessor properties are inherited for both get access and set access.</p>
    <p>Every ordinary object has a Boolean-valued [[Extensible]] internal slot which is used to fulfill the extensibility-related internal method invariants specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref>. Namely, once the value of an object's [[Extensible]] internal slot has been set to *false*, it is no longer possible to add properties to the object, to modify the value of the object's [[Prototype]] internal slot, or to subsequently change the value of [[Extensible]] to *true*.</p>
    <p>In the following algorithm descriptions, assume _O_ is an ordinary object, _P_ is a property key value, _V_ is any ECMAScript language value, and _Desc_ is a Property Descriptor record.</p>
    <p>Each ordinary object internal method delegates to a similarly-named abstract operation. If such an abstract operation depends on another internal method, then the internal method is invoked on _O_ rather than calling the similarly-named abstract operation directly.

    <h1>Built-in Function Objects</h1>
    <p>The built-in function objects defined in this specification may be implemented as either ECMAScript function objects (<emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-function-objects"></emu-xref>) whose behaviour is provided using ECMAScript code or as implementation provided function exotic objects whose behaviour is provided in some other manner. In either case, the effect of calling such functions must conform to their specifications. An implementation may also provide additional built-in function objects that are not defined in this specification.</p>
    <p>If a built-in function object is implemented as an ECMAScript function object, it must have all the internal slots described in <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-function-objects"></emu-xref> ([[Prototype]], [[Extensible]], and the slots listed in <emu-xref href="#table-internal-slots-of-ecmascript-function-objects"></emu-xref>), and [[InitialName]]. The value of the [[InitialName]] internal slot is a String value that is the initial name of the function. It is used by <emu-xref href="#sec-function.prototype.tostring"></emu-xref>.</p>
    <p>If a built-in function object is implemented as an exotic object, it must have the ordinary object behaviour specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref>. All such function exotic objects have [[Prototype]], [[Extensible]], [[Realm]], and [[InitialName]] internal slots, with the same meanings as above.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function object has the %Function.prototype% object as the initial value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot.</p>
    <p>The behaviour specified for each built-in function via algorithm steps or other means is the specification of the function body behaviour for both [[Call]] and [[Construct]] invocations of the function. However, [[Construct]] invocation is not supported by all built-in functions. For each built-in function, when invoked with [[Call]], the [[Call]] _thisArgument_ provides the *this* value, the [[Call]] _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the NewTarget value is *undefined*. When invoked with [[Construct]], the *this* value is uninitialized, the [[Construct]] _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the [[Construct]] _newTarget_ parameter provides the NewTarget value. If the built-in function is implemented as an ECMAScript function object then this specified behaviour must be implemented by the ECMAScript code that is the body of the function. Built-in functions that are ECMAScript function objects must be strict functions. If a built-in constructor has any [[Call]] behaviour other than throwing a *TypeError* exception, an ECMAScript implementation of the function must be done in a manner that does not cause the function's [[IsClassConstructor]] internal slot to have the value *true*.</p>
    <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function. When a built-in constructor is called as part of a `new` expression the _argumentsList_ parameter of the invoked [[Construct]] internal method provides the values for the built-in constructor's named parameters.</p>
    <p>Built-in functions that are not constructors do not have a *"prototype"* property unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.</p>
    <p>If a built-in function object is not implemented as an ECMAScript function it must provide [[Call]] and [[Construct]] internal methods that conform to the following definitions:</p>

      <p>An Array is an exotic object that gives special treatment to array index property keys (see <emu-xref href="#sec-object-type"></emu-xref>). A property whose property name is an array index is also called an <em>element</em>. Every Array has a non-configurable *"length"* property whose value is always a non-negative integral Number whose mathematical value is less than 2<sup>32</sup>. The value of the *"length"* property is numerically greater than the name of every own property whose name is an array index; whenever an own property of an Array is created or changed, other properties are adjusted as necessary to maintain this invariant. Specifically, whenever an own property is added whose name is an array index, the value of the *"length"* property is changed, if necessary, to be one more than the numeric value of that array index; and whenever the value of the *"length"* property is changed, every own property whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new length is deleted. This constraint applies only to own properties of an Array and is unaffected by *"length"* or array index properties that may be inherited from its prototypes.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-arguments-exotic-objects">
      <h1>Arguments Exotic Objects</h1>

      <p>Most ECMAScript functions make an arguments object available to their code. Depending upon the characteristics of the function definition, its arguments object is either an ordinary object or an arguments exotic object. An arguments exotic object is an exotic object whose array index properties map to the formal parameters bindings of an invocation of its associated ECMAScript function.</p>

      <p>An object is an <dfn id="arguments-exotic-object" variants="arguments exotic objects">arguments exotic object</dfn> if its internal methods use the following implementations, with the ones not specified here using those found in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref>. These methods are installed in CreateMappedArgumentsObject.</p>

      <emu-note>
        <p>While CreateUnmappedArgumentsObject is grouped into this clause, it creates an ordinary object, not an arguments exotic object.</p>
      </emu-note>

      <p>Arguments exotic objects have the same internal slots as ordinary objects. They also have a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot. Ordinary arguments objects also have a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot whose value is always undefined. For ordinary argument objects the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot is only used by `Object.prototype.toString` (<emu-xref href="#sec-object.prototype.tostring"></emu-xref>) to identify them as such.</p>

      <emu-note>
        <p>The integer-indexed data properties of an arguments exotic object whose numeric name values are less than the number of formal parameters of the corresponding function object initially share their values with the corresponding argument bindings in the function's execution context. This means that changing the property changes the corresponding value of the argument binding and vice-versa. This correspondence is broken if such a property is deleted and then redefined or if the property is changed into an accessor property. If the arguments object is an ordinary object, the values of its properties are simply a copy of the arguments passed to the function and there is no dynamic linkage between the property values and the formal parameter values.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The ParameterMap object and its property values are used as a device for specifying the arguments object correspondence to argument bindings. The ParameterMap object and the objects that are the values of its properties are not directly observable from ECMAScript code. An ECMAScript implementation does not need to actually create or use such objects to implement the specified semantics.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>Ordinary arguments objects define a non-configurable accessor property named *"callee"* which throws a *TypeError* exception on access. The *"callee"* property has a more specific meaning for arguments exotic objects, which are created only for some class of non-strict functions. The definition of this property in the ordinary variant exists to ensure that it is not defined in any other manner by conforming ECMAScript implementations.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>ECMAScript implementations of arguments exotic objects have historically contained an accessor property named *"caller"*. Prior to ECMAScript 2017, this specification included the definition of a throwing *"caller"* property on ordinary arguments objects. Since implementations do not contain this extension any longer, ECMAScript 2017 dropped the requirement for a throwing *"caller"* accessor.</p>

    <p>When a handler method is called to provide the implementation of a Proxy object internal method, the handler method is passed the proxy's target object as a parameter. A proxy's handler object does not necessarily have a method corresponding to every essential internal method. Invoking an internal method on the proxy results in the invocation of the corresponding internal method on the proxy's target object if the handler object does not have a method corresponding to the internal trap.</p>
    <p>The [[ProxyHandler]] and [[ProxyTarget]] internal slots of a Proxy object are always initialized when the object is created and typically may not be modified. Some Proxy objects are created in a manner that permits them to be subsequently <em>revoked</em>. When a proxy is revoked, its [[ProxyHandler]] and [[ProxyTarget]] internal slots are set to *null* causing subsequent invocations of internal methods on that Proxy object to throw a *TypeError* exception.</p>
    <p>Because Proxy objects permit the implementation of internal methods to be provided by arbitrary ECMAScript code, it is possible to define a Proxy object whose handler methods violates the invariants defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref>. Some of the internal method invariants defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref> are essential integrity invariants. These invariants are explicitly enforced by the Proxy object internal methods specified in this section. An ECMAScript implementation must be robust in the presence of all possible invariant violations.</p>
    <p>In the following algorithm descriptions, assume _O_ is an ECMAScript Proxy object, _P_ is a property key value, _V_ is any ECMAScript language value and _Desc_ is a Property Descriptor record.</p>

    <emu-grammar type="definition">
      SourceCharacter ::
        &gt; any Unicode code point
    </emu-grammar>
    <p>ECMAScript code is expressed using Unicode. ECMAScript source text is a sequence of code points. All Unicode code point values from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, including surrogate code points, may occur in source text where permitted by the ECMAScript grammars. The actual encodings used to store and interchange ECMAScript source text is not relevant to this specification. Regardless of the external source text encoding, a conforming ECMAScript implementation processes the source text as if it was an equivalent sequence of |SourceCharacter| values, each |SourceCharacter| being a Unicode code point. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalization of source text, or behave as though they were performing normalization of source text.</p>
    <p>The components of a combining character sequence are treated as individual Unicode code points even though a user might think of the whole sequence as a single character.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>In string literals, regular expression literals, template literals and identifiers, any Unicode code point may also be expressed using Unicode escape sequences that explicitly express a code point's numeric value. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored as part of the comment.</p>
      <p>ECMAScript differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour of Unicode escape sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A`, for example, occurs within a single-line comment, it is interpreted as a line terminator (Unicode code point U+000A is LINE FEED (LF)) and therefore the next code point is not part of the comment. Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A` occurs within a string literal in a Java program, it is likewise interpreted as a line terminator, which is not allowed within a string literal&mdash;one must write `\\n` instead of `\\u000A` to cause a LINE FEED (LF) to be part of the String value of a string literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot contribute to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a string literal in an ECMAScript program always contributes to the literal and is never interpreted as a line terminator or as a code point that might terminate the string literal.</p>

          Function code that is supplied as the arguments to the built-in Function, Generator, AsyncFunction, and AsyncGenerator constructors is strict mode code if the last argument is a String that when processed is a |FunctionBody| that begins with a Directive Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.

<emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar">
  <h1>ECMAScript Language: Lexical Grammar</h1>
  <p>The source text of an ECMAScript |Script| or |Module| is first converted into a sequence of input elements, which are tokens, line terminators, comments, or white space. The source text is scanned from left to right, repeatedly taking the longest possible sequence of code points as the next input element.</p>
  <p>There are several situations where the identification of lexical input elements is sensitive to the syntactic grammar context that is consuming the input elements. This requires multiple goal symbols for the lexical grammar. The |InputElementRegExpOrTemplateTail| goal is used in syntactic grammar contexts where a |RegularExpressionLiteral|, a |TemplateMiddle|, or a |TemplateTail| is permitted. The |InputElementRegExp| goal symbol is used in all syntactic grammar contexts where a |RegularExpressionLiteral| is permitted but neither a |TemplateMiddle|, nor a |TemplateTail| is permitted. The |InputElementTemplateTail| goal is used in all syntactic grammar contexts where a |TemplateMiddle| or a |TemplateTail| is permitted but a |RegularExpressionLiteral| is not permitted. In all other contexts, |InputElementDiv| is used as the lexical goal symbol.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>The use of multiple lexical goals ensures that there are no lexical ambiguities that would affect automatic semicolon insertion. For example, there are no syntactic grammar contexts where both a leading division or division-assignment, and a leading |RegularExpressionLiteral| are permitted. This is not affected by semicolon insertion (see <emu-xref href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>); in examples such as the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      a = b
      /hi/g.exec(c).map(d);
    </code></pre>
    <p>where the first non-whitespace, non-comment code point after a |LineTerminator| is U+002F (SOLIDUS) and the syntactic context allows division or division-assignment, no semicolon is inserted at the |LineTerminator|. That is, the above example is interpreted in the same way as:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      a = b / hi / g.exec(c).map(d);
    </code></pre>

    <h1>Unicode Format-Control Characters</h1>
    <p>The Unicode format-control characters (i.e., the characters in category &ldquo;Cf&rdquo; in the Unicode Character Database such as LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK or RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK) are control codes used to control the formatting of a range of text in the absence of higher-level protocols for this (such as mark-up languages).</p>
    <p>It is useful to allow format-control characters in source text to facilitate editing and display. All format control characters may be used within comments, and within string literals, template literals, and regular expression literals.</p>
    <p>U+200C (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER) are format-control characters that are used to make necessary distinctions when forming words or phrases in certain languages. In ECMAScript source text these code points may also be used in an |IdentifierName| after the first character.</p>
    <p>U+FEFF (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE) is a format-control character used primarily at the start of a text to mark it as Unicode and to allow detection of the text's encoding and byte order. &lt;ZWNBSP&gt; characters intended for this purpose can sometimes also appear after the start of a text, for example as a result of concatenating files. In ECMAScript source text &lt;ZWNBSP&gt; code points are treated as white space characters (see <emu-xref href="#sec-white-space"></emu-xref>).</p>
    <p>The special treatment of certain format-control characters outside of comments, string literals, and regular expression literals is summarized in <emu-xref href="#table-format-control-code-point-usage"></emu-xref>.</p>

    <p>Like white space code points, line terminator code points are used to improve source text readability and to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other.

      <h1>Identifier Names</h1>
      <p>Unicode escape sequences are permitted in an |IdentifierName|, where they contribute a single Unicode code point to the |IdentifierName|. The code point is expressed by the |CodePoint| of the |UnicodeEscapeSequence| (see <emu-xref href="#sec-literals-string-literals"></emu-xref>). The `\\` preceding the |UnicodeEscapeSequence| and the `u` and `{ }` code units, if they appear, do not contribute code points to the |IdentifierName|. A |UnicodeEscapeSequence| cannot be used to put a code point into an |IdentifierName| that would otherwise be illegal. In other words, if a `\\` |UnicodeEscapeSequence| sequence were replaced by the |SourceCharacter| it contributes, the result must still be a valid |IdentifierName| that has the exact same sequence of |SourceCharacter| elements as the original |IdentifierName|. All interpretations of |IdentifierName| within this specification are based upon their actual code points regardless of whether or not an escape sequence was used to contribute any particular code point.</p>
      <p>Two |IdentifierName|s that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard are <em>not</em> equal unless, after replacement of each |UnicodeEscapeSequence|, they are represented by the exact same sequence of code points.</p>

      <h1>Keywords and Reserved Words</h1>
      <p>A <dfn variants="keywords">keyword</dfn> is a token that matches |IdentifierName|, but also has a syntactic use; that is, it appears literally, in a `fixed width` font, in some syntactic production. The keywords of ECMAScript include `if`, `while`, `async`, `await`, and many others.</p>
      <p>A <dfn variants="reserved words">reserved word</dfn> is an |IdentifierName| that cannot be used as an identifier. Many keywords are reserved words, but some are not, and some are reserved only in certain contexts. `if` and `while` are reserved words. `await` is reserved only inside async functions and modules. `async` is not reserved; it can be used as a variable name or statement label without restriction.</p>
      <p>This specification uses a combination of grammatical productions and early error rules to specify which names are valid identifiers and which are reserved words. All tokens in the |ReservedWord| list below, except for `await` and `yield`, are unconditionally reserved. Exceptions for `await` and `yield` are specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-identifiers"></emu-xref>, using parameterized syntactic productions. Lastly, several early error rules restrict the set of valid identifiers. See <emu-xref href="#sec-identifiers-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-let-and-const-declarations-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-for-in-and-for-of-statements-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>, and <emu-xref href="#sec-class-definitions-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>. In summary, there are five categories of identifier names:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Those that are always allowed as identifiers, and are not keywords, such as `Math`, `window`, `toString`, and `_`;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Those that are never allowed as identifiers, namely the |ReservedWord|s listed below except `await` and `yield`;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Those that are contextually allowed as identifiers, namely `await` and `yield`;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Those that are contextually disallowed as identifiers, in strict mode code: `let`, `static`, `implements`, `interface`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, and `public`;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Those that are always allowed as identifiers, but also appear as keywords within certain syntactic productions, at places where |Identifier| is not allowed: `as`, `async`, `from`, `get`, `meta`, `of`, `set`, and `target`.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The term <dfn variants="conditional keywords">conditional keyword</dfn>, or <dfn variants="contextual keywords">contextual keyword</dfn>, is sometimes used to refer to the keywords that fall in the last three categories, and thus can be used as identifiers in some contexts and as keywords in others.</p>

        <p>An |IdentifierName| can contain `\\` |UnicodeEscapeSequence|s, but it is not possible to declare a variable named "else" by spelling it `els\u{65}`.

      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>`enum` is not currently used as a keyword in this specification. It is a <em>future reserved word</em>, set aside for use as a keyword in future language extensions.</p>
        <p>Similarly, `implements`, `interface`, `package`, `private`, `protected`, and `public` are future reserved words in strict mode code.</p>

        <p>A regular expression literal is an input element that is converted to a RegExp object (see <emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects"></emu-xref>) each time the literal is evaluated. Two regular expression literals in a program evaluate to regular expression objects that never compare as `===` to each other even if the two literals' contents are identical. A RegExp object may also be created at runtime by `new RegExp` or calling the RegExp constructor as a function (see <emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-constructor"></emu-xref>).</p>

      <p>The productions below describe the syntax for a regular expression literal and are used by the input element scanner to find the end of the regular expression literal. The source text comprising the |RegularExpressionBody| and the |RegularExpressionFlags| are subsequently parsed again using the more stringent ECMAScript Regular Expression grammar (<emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>).</p>
      <p>An implementation may extend the ECMAScript Regular Expression grammar defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>, but it must not extend the |RegularExpressionBody| and |RegularExpressionFlags| productions defined below or the productions used by these productions.</p>

    <h1>Automatic Semicolon Insertion</h1>
    <p>Most ECMAScript statements and declarations must be terminated with a semicolon. Such semicolons may always appear explicitly in the source text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in certain situations. These situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code token stream in those situations.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-rules-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion" namespace="asi-rules">
      <h1>Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion</h1>
      <p>In the following rules, &ldquo;token&rdquo; means the actual recognized lexical token determined using the current lexical goal symbol as described in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar"></emu-xref>.</p>
      <p>There are three basic rules of semicolon insertion:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, a token (called the <em>offending token</em>) is encountered that is not allowed by any production of the grammar, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the offending token if one or more of the following conditions is true:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The offending token is separated from the previous token by at least one |LineTerminator|.
            </li>
            <li>
              The offending token is `}`.
            </li>
            <li>
              The previous token is `)` and the inserted semicolon would then be parsed as the terminating semicolon of a do-while statement (<emu-xref href="#sec-do-while-statement"></emu-xref>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, the end of the input stream of tokens is encountered and the parser is unable to parse the input token stream as a single instance of the goal nonterminal, then a semicolon is automatically inserted at the end of the input stream.
        </li>
        <li>
          When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, a token is encountered that is allowed by some production of the grammar, but the production is a <em>restricted production</em> and the token would be the first token for a terminal or nonterminal immediately following the annotation &ldquo;[no |LineTerminator| here]&rdquo; within the restricted production (and therefore such a token is called a restricted token), and the restricted token is separated from the previous token by at least one |LineTerminator|, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the restricted token.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, there is an additional overriding condition on the preceding rules: a semicolon is never inserted automatically if the semicolon would then be parsed as an empty statement or if that semicolon would become one of the two semicolons in the header of a `for` statement (see <emu-xref href="#sec-for-statement"></emu-xref>).</p>

        <p>The practical effect of these restricted productions is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a `++` or `--` token is encountered where the parser would treat it as a postfix operator, and at least one |LineTerminator| occurred between the preceding token and the `++` or `--` token, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the `++` or `--` token.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a `continue`, `break`, `return`, `throw`, or `yield` token is encountered and a |LineTerminator| is encountered before the next token, a semicolon is automatically inserted after the `continue`, `break`, `return`, `throw`, or `yield` token.
          </li>
          <li>
            When arrow function parameter(s) are followed by a |LineTerminator| before a `=>` token, a semicolon is automatically inserted and the punctuator causes a syntax error.
          </li>
          <li>
            When an `async` token is followed by a |LineTerminator| before a `function` or |IdentifierName| or `(` token, a semicolon is automatically inserted and the `async` token is not treated as part of the same expression or class element as the following tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            When an `async` token is followed by a |LineTerminator| before a `*` token, a semicolon is automatically inserted and the punctuator causes a syntax error.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The resulting practical advice to ECMAScript programmers is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A postfix `++` or `--` operator should be on the same line as its operand.
          </li>
          <li>
            An |Expression| in a `return` or `throw` statement or an |AssignmentExpression| in a `yield` expression should start on the same line as the `return`, `throw`, or `yield` token.
          </li>
          <li>
            A |LabelIdentifier| in a `break` or `continue` statement should be on the same line as the `break` or `continue` token.
          </li>
          <li>
            The end of an arrow function's parameter(s) and its `=>` should be on the same line.
          </li>
          <li>
            The `async` token preceding an asynchronous function or method should be on the same line as the immediately following token.

      <h1>Interesting Cases of Automatic Semicolon Insertion</h1>
      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
      <p>ECMAScript programs can be written in a style with very few semicolons by relying on automatic semicolon insertion. As described above, semicolons are not inserted at every newline, and automatic semicolon insertion can depend on multiple tokens across line terminators.</p>

      <p>As new syntactic features are added to ECMAScript, additional grammar productions could be added that cause lines relying on automatic semicolon insertion preceding them to change grammar productions when parsed.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of this section, a case of automatic semicolon insertion is considered interesting if it is a place where a semicolon may or may not be inserted, depending on the source text which precedes it.

        <p>Given the above definition of equality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            String comparison can be forced by: `\`${a}\` == \`${b}\``.
          </li>
          <li>
            Numeric comparison can be forced by: `+a == +b`.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boolean comparison can be forced by: `!a == !b`.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The equality operators maintain the following invariants:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `A != B` is equivalent to `!(A == B)`.
          </li>
          <li>
            `A == B` is equivalent to `B == A`, except in the order of evaluation of `A` and `B`.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The equality operator is not always transitive. For example, there might be two distinct String objects, each representing the same String value; each String object would be considered equal to the String value by the `==` operator, but the two String objects would not be equal to each other. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `new String("a") == "a"` and `"a" == new String("a")` are both *true*.
          </li>
          <li>
            `new String("a") == new String("a")` is *false*.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>Comparison of Strings uses a simple equality test on sequences of code unit values. There is no attempt to use the more complex, semantically oriented definitions of character or string equality and collating order defined in the Unicode specification. Therefore Strings values that are canonically equal according to the Unicode standard could test as unequal. In effect this algorithm assumes that both Strings are already in normalized form.</p>

The iterator object is never directly accessible to ECMAScript code. The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified but must conform to the rules specified below.
        </emu-alg>
        <p>The iterator's `throw` and `return` methods are *null* and are never invoked. The iterator's `next` method processes object properties to determine whether the property key should be returned as an iterator value. Returned property keys do not include keys that are Symbols. Properties of the target object may be deleted during enumeration. A property that is deleted before it is processed by the iterator's `next` method is ignored. If new properties are added to the target object during enumeration, the newly added properties are not guaranteed to be processed in the active enumeration. A property name will be returned by the iterator's `next` method at most once in any enumeration.</p>
        <p>Enumerating the properties of the target object includes enumerating properties of its prototype, and the prototype of the prototype, and so on, recursively; but a property of a prototype is not processed if it has the same name as a property that has already been processed by the iterator's `next` method. The values of [[Enumerable]] attributes are not considered when determining if a property of a prototype object has already been processed. The enumerable property names of prototype objects must be obtained by invoking EnumerateObjectProperties passing the prototype object as the argument. EnumerateObjectProperties must obtain the own property keys of the target object by calling its [[OwnPropertyKeys]] internal method. Property attributes of the target object must be obtained by calling its [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method.</p>
        <p>In addition, if neither _O_ nor any object in its prototype chain is a Proxy exotic object, Integer-Indexed exotic object, module namespace exotic object, or implementation provided exotic object, then the iterator must behave as would the iterator given by CreateForInIterator(_O_) until one of the following occurs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the value of the [[Prototype]] internal slot of _O_ or an object in its prototype chain changes,</li>
          <li>a property is removed from _O_ or an object in its prototype chain,</li>
          <li>a property is added to an object in _O_'s prototype chain, or</li>
          <li>the value of the [[Enumerable]] attribute of a property of _O_ or an object in its prototype chain changes.</li>

        <p>For ease of specification, private methods and accessors are included alongside private fields in the [[PrivateElements]] slot of class instances. However, any given object has either all or none of the private methods and accessors defined by a given class. This feature has been designed so that implementations may choose to implement private methods and accessors using a strategy which does not require tracking each method or accessor individually.</p>
        <p>For example, an implementation could directly associate instance private methods with their corresponding Private Name and track, for each object, which class constructors have run with that object as their `this` value. Looking up an instance private method on an object then consists of checking that the class constructor which defines the method has been used to initialize the object, then returning the method associated with the Private Name.</p>
        <p>This differs from private fields: because field initializers can throw during class instantiation, an individual object may have some proper subset of the private fields of a given class, and so private fields must in general be tracked individually.</p>

        <p>Early errors specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-scripts-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref> prevent name conflicts between function/var declarations and let/const/class declarations as well as redeclaration of let/const/class bindings for declaration contained within a single |Script|. However, such conflicts and redeclarations that span more than one |Script| are detected as runtime errors during GlobalDeclarationInstantiation. If any such errors are detected, no bindings are instantiated for the script. However, if the global object is defined using Proxy exotic objects then the runtime tests for conflicting declarations may be unreliable resulting in an abrupt completion and some global declarations not being instantiated. If this occurs, the code for the |Script| is not evaluated.</p>
        <p>Unlike explicit var or function declarations, properties that are directly created on the global object result in global bindings that may be shadowed by let/const/class declarations.</p>

        <emu-clause id="sec-example-cyclic-module-record-graphs">
          <h1>Example Cyclic Module Record Graphs</h1>

          <p>This non-normative section gives a series of examples of the linking and evaluation of a few common module graphs, with a specific focus on how errors can occur.</p>

          <p>First consider the following simple module graph:</p>

          <emu-figure id="figure-module-graph-simple" caption="A simple module graph">
            <img alt="A module graph in which module A depends on module B, and module B depends on module C" width="121" height="211" src="img/module-graph-simple.svg">
          </emu-figure>

          <p>Let's first assume that there are no error conditions. When a host first calls _A_.Link(), this will complete successfully by assumption, and recursively link modules _B_ and _C_ as well, such that _A_.[[Status]] = _B_.[[Status]] = _C_.[[Status]] = ~linked~. This preparatory step can be performed at any time. Later, when the host is ready to incur any possible side effects of the modules, it can call _A_.Evaluate(), which will complete successfully, returning a Promise resolving to *undefined* (again by assumption), recursively having evaluated first _C_ and then _B_. Each module's [[Status]] at this point will be ~evaluated~.</p>
          <p>Consider then cases involving linking errors. If InnerModuleLinking of _C_ succeeds but, thereafter, fails for _B_, for example because it imports something that _C_ does not provide, then the original _A_.Link() will fail, and both _A_ and _B_'s [[Status]] remain ~unlinked~. _C_'s [[Status]] has become ~linked~, though.</p>

          <p>Finally, consider a case involving evaluation errors. If InnerModuleEvaluation of _C_ succeeds but, thereafter, fails for _B_, for example because _B_ contains code that throws an exception, then the original _A_.Evaluate() will fail, returning a rejected Promise. The resulting exception will be recorded in both _A_ and _B_'s [[EvaluationError]] fields, and their [[Status]] will become ~evaluated~. _C_ will also become ~evaluated~ but, in contrast to _A_ and _B_, will remain without an [[EvaluationError]], as it successfully completed evaluation. Storing the exception ensures that any time a host tries to reuse _A_ or _B_ by calling their Evaluate() method, it will encounter the same exception. (Hosts are not required to reuse Cyclic Module Records; similarly, hosts are not required to expose the exception objects thrown by these methods. However, the specification enables such uses.)</p>

          <p>The difference here between linking and evaluation errors is due to how evaluation must be only performed once, as it can cause side effects; it is thus important to remember whether evaluation has already been performed, even if unsuccessfully. (In the error case, it makes sense to also remember the exception because otherwise subsequent Evaluate() calls would have to synthesize a new one.) Linking, on the other hand, is side-effect-free, and thus even if it fails, it can be retried at a later time with no issues.</p>

          <p>Now consider a different type of error condition:</p>

          <emu-figure id="figure-module-graph-missing" caption="A module graph with an unresolvable module">
            <img alt="A module graph in which module A depends on a missing (unresolvable) module, represented by ???" width="121" height="121" src="img/module-graph-missing.svg">
          </emu-figure>

          <p>In this scenario, module _A_ declares a dependency on some other module, but no Module Record exists for that module, i.e. HostResolveImportedModule throws an exception when asked for it. This could occur for a variety of reasons, such as the corresponding resource not existing, or the resource existing but ParseModule throwing an exception when trying to parse the resulting source text. Hosts can choose to expose the cause of failure via the exception they throw from HostResolveImportedModule. In any case, this exception causes a linking failure, which as before results in _A_'s [[Status]] remaining ~unlinked~.</p>

          <p>Now, consider a module graph with a cycle:</p>

          <emu-figure id="figure-module-graph-cycle" caption="A cyclic module graph">
            <img alt="A module graph in which module A depends on module B and C, but module B also depends on module A" width="181" height="121" src="img/module-graph-cycle.svg">
          </emu-figure>

          <p>Here we assume that the entry point is module _A_, so that the host proceeds by calling _A_.Link(), which performs InnerModuleLinking on _A_. This in turn calls InnerModuleLinking on _B_. Because of the cycle, this again triggers InnerModuleLinking on _A_, but at this point it is a no-op since _A_.[[Status]] is already ~linking~. _B_.[[Status]] itself remains ~linking~ when control gets back to _A_ and InnerModuleLinking is triggered on _C_. After this returns with _C_.[[Status]] being ~linked~, both _A_ and _B_ transition from ~linking~ to ~linked~ together; this is by design, since they form a strongly connected component.</p>

          <p>An analogous story occurs for the evaluation phase of a cyclic module graph, in the success case.</p>

          <p>Now consider a case where _A_ has an linking error; for example, it tries to import a binding from _C_ that does not exist. In that case, the above steps still occur, including the early return from the second call to InnerModuleLinking on _A_. However, once we unwind back to the original InnerModuleLinking on _A_, it fails during InitializeEnvironment, namely right after _C_.ResolveExport(). The thrown *SyntaxError* exception propagates up to _A_.Link, which resets all modules that are currently on its _stack_ (these are always exactly the modules that are still ~linking~). Hence both _A_ and _B_ become ~unlinked~. Note that _C_ is left as ~linked~.</p>

          <p>Alternatively, consider a case where _A_ has an evaluation error; for example, its source code throws an exception. In that case, the evaluation-time analog of the above steps still occurs, including the early return from the second call to InnerModuleEvaluation on _A_. However, once we unwind back to the original InnerModuleEvaluation on _A_, it fails by assumption. The exception thrown propagates up to _A_.Evaluate(), which records the error in all modules that are currently on its _stack_ (i.e., the modules that are still ~evaluating~) as well as via [[AsyncParentModules]], which form a chain for modules which contain or depend on top-level `await` through the whole dependency graph through the AsyncModuleExecutionRejected algorithm. Hence both _A_ and _B_ become ~evaluated~ and the exception is recorded in both _A_ and _B_'s [[EvaluationError]] fields, while _C_ is left as ~evaluated~ with no [[EvaluationError]].</p>

          <p>Lastly, consider a module graph with a cycle, where all modules complete asynchronously:</p>
          <emu-figure id="figure-module-graph-cycle-async" caption="An asynchronous cyclic module graph">
            <img alt="A module graph in which module A depends on module B and C, module B depends on module D, module C depends on module D and E, and module D depends on module A" width="241" height="211" src="img/module-graph-cycle-async.svg">
          </emu-figure>
          <p>Linking happens as before, and all modules end up with [[Status]] set to ~linked~.</p>

          <p>Calling _A_.Evaluate() calls InnerModuleEvaluation on _A_, _B_, and _D_, which all transition to ~evaluating~. Then InnerModuleEvaluation is called on _A_ again, which is a no-op because it is already ~evaluating~. At this point, _D_.[[PendingAsyncDependencies]] is 0, so ExecuteAsyncModule(_D_) is called and we call _D_.ExecuteModule with a new PromiseCapability tracking the asynchronous execution of _D_. We unwind back to the InnerModuleEvaluation on _B_, setting _B_.[[PendingAsyncDependencies]] to 1 and _B_.[[AsyncEvaluation]] to *true*. We unwind back to the original InnerModuleEvaluation on _A_, setting _A_.[[PendingAsyncDependencies]] to 1. In the next iteration of the loop over _A_'s dependencies, we call InnerModuleEvaluation on _C_ and thus on _D_ (again a no-op) and _E_. As _E_ has no dependencies and is not part of a cycle, we call ExecuteAsyncModule(_E_) in the same manner as _D_ and _E_ is immediately removed from the stack. We unwind once more to the original InnerModuleEvaluation on _A_, setting _C_.[[AsyncEvaluation]] to *true*. Now we finish the loop over _A_'s dependencies, set _A_.[[AsyncEvaluation]] to *true*, and remove the entire strongly connected component from the stack, transitioning all of the modules to ~evaluating-async~ at once. At this point, the fields of the modules are as given in <emu-xref href="#table-module-graph-cycle-async-fields-1"></emu-xref>.</p>

<emu-clause id="sec-error-handling-and-language-extensions">
  <h1>Error Handling and Language Extensions</h1>
  <p>An implementation must report most errors at the time the relevant ECMAScript language construct is evaluated. An <dfn id="early-error" variants="early errors">early error</dfn> is an error that can be detected and reported prior to the evaluation of any construct in the |Script| containing the error. The presence of an early error prevents the evaluation of the construct. An implementation must report early errors in a |Script| as part of parsing that |Script| in ParseScript. Early errors in a |Module| are reported at the point when the |Module| would be evaluated and the |Module| is never initialized. Early errors in <b>eval</b> code are reported at the time `eval` is called and prevent evaluation of the <b>eval</b> code. All errors that are not early errors are runtime errors.</p>
  <p>An implementation must report as an early error any occurrence of a condition that is listed in a &ldquo;Static Semantics: Early Errors&rdquo; subclause of this specification.</p>
  <p>An implementation shall not treat other kinds of errors as early errors even if the compiler can prove that a construct cannot execute without error under any circumstances. An implementation may issue an early warning in such a case, but it should not report the error until the relevant construct is actually executed.</p>
  <p>An implementation shall report all errors as specified, except for the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

    <p>An implementation must not extend this specification in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ECMAScript function objects defined using syntactic constructors in strict mode code must not be created with own properties named *"caller"* or *"arguments"*. Such own properties also must not be created for function objects defined using an |ArrowFunction|, |MethodDefinition|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |GeneratorExpression|, |AsyncGeneratorDeclaration|, |AsyncGeneratorExpression|, |ClassDeclaration|, |ClassExpression|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionExpression|, or |AsyncArrowFunction| regardless of whether the definition is contained in strict mode code. Built-in functions, strict functions created using the Function constructor, generator functions created using the Generator constructor, async functions created using the AsyncFunction constructor, and functions created using the `bind` method also must not be created with such own properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an implementation extends any function object with an own property named *"caller"* the value of that property, as observed using [[Get]] or [[GetOwnProperty]], must not be a strict function object. If it is an accessor property, the function that is the value of the property's [[Get]] attribute must never return a strict function when called.
      </li>
      <li>
        Neither mapped nor unmapped arguments objects may be created with an own property named *"caller"*.

      <li>
        The RegExp pattern grammars in <emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref> and <emu-xref href="#sec-regular-expressions-patterns"></emu-xref> must not be extended to recognize any of the source characters A-Z or a-z as |IdentityEscape[+UnicodeMode]| when the <sub>[UnicodeMode]</sub> grammar parameter is present.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Syntactic Grammar must not be extended in any manner that allows the token `:` to immediately follow source text that is matched by the |BindingIdentifier| nonterminal symbol.
      </li>
      <li>
        When processing strict mode code, an implementation must not relax the early error rules of <emu-xref href="#sec-numeric-literals-early-errors"></emu-xref>.
      </li>

<emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-standard-built-in-objects">
  <h1>ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects</h1>
  <p>There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript |Script| or |Module| begins execution. One, the global object, is part of the global environment of the executing program. Others are accessible as initial properties of the global object or indirectly as properties of accessible built-in objects.</p>
  <p>Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function is a built-in function object with the characteristics described in <emu-xref href="#sec-built-in-function-objects"></emu-xref>. Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]] internal slot of a built-in object initially has the value *true*. Every built-in function object has a [[Realm]] internal slot whose value is the Realm Record of the realm for which the object was initially created.</p>
  <p>Many built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with arguments. Some of them furthermore are constructors: they are functions intended for use with the `new` operator. For each built-in function, this specification describes the arguments required by that function and the properties of that function object. For each built-in constructor, this specification furthermore describes properties of the prototype object of that constructor and properties of specific object instances returned by a `new` expression that invokes that constructor.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function or constructor is given fewer arguments than the function is specified to require, the function or constructor shall behave exactly as if it had been given sufficient additional arguments, each such argument being the *undefined* value. Such missing arguments are considered to be &ldquo;not present&rdquo; and may be identified in that manner by specification algorithms. In the description of a particular function, the terms &ldquo;*this* value&rdquo; and &ldquo;NewTarget&rdquo; have the meanings given in <emu-xref href="#sec-built-in-function-objects"></emu-xref>.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function or constructor described is given more arguments than the function is specified to allow, the extra arguments are evaluated by the call and then ignored by the function. However, an implementation may define implementation specific behaviour relating to such arguments as long as the behaviour is not the throwing of a *TypeError* exception that is predicated simply on the presence of an extra argument.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>Implementations that add additional capabilities to the set of built-in functions are encouraged to do so by adding new functions rather than adding new parameters to existing functions.</p>
  </emu-note>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in constructor has the Function prototype object, which is the initial value of the expression `Function.prototype` (<emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-function-prototype-object"></emu-xref>), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in prototype object has the Object prototype object, which is the initial value of the expression `Object.prototype` (<emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-object-prototype-object"></emu-xref>), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot, except the Object prototype object itself.</p>
  <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.</p>
  <p>Each built-in function defined in this specification is created by calling the CreateBuiltinFunction abstract operation (<emu-xref href="#sec-createbuiltinfunction"></emu-xref>). The values of the _length_ and _name_ parameters are the initial values of the *"length"* and *"name"* properties as discussed below. The values of the _prefix_ parameter are similarly discussed below.</p>
  <p>Every built-in function object, including constructors, has a *"length"* property whose value is a non-negative integral Number. Unless otherwise specified, this value is equal to the number of required parameters shown in the subclause heading for the function description. Optional parameters and rest parameters are not included in the parameter count.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>For example, the function object that is the initial value of the *"map"* property of the Array prototype object is described under the subclause heading &laquo;Array.prototype.map (callbackFn [ , thisArg])&raquo; which shows the two named arguments callbackFn and thisArg, the latter being optional; therefore the value of the *"length"* property of that function object is *1*<sub>𝔽</sub>.</p>
  </emu-note>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the *"length"* property of a built-in function object has the attributes { [[Writable]]: *false*, [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* }.</p>
  <p>Every built-in function object, including constructors, has a *"name"* property whose value is a String. Unless otherwise specified, this value is the name that is given to the function in this specification. Functions that are identified as anonymous functions use the empty String as the value of the *"name"* property. For functions that are specified as properties of objects, the name value is the property name string used to access the function. Functions that are specified as get or set accessor functions of built-in properties have *"get"* or *"set"* (respectively) passed to the _prefix_ parameter when calling CreateBuiltinFunction.</p>
  <p>The value of the *"name"* property is explicitly specified for each built-in functions whose property key is a Symbol value. If such an explicitly specified value starts with the prefix *"get "* or *"set "* and the function for which it is specified is a get or set accessor function of a built-in property, the value without the prefix is passed to the _name_ parameter, and the value *"get"* or *"set"* (respectively) is passed to the _prefix_ parameter when calling CreateBuiltinFunction.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the *"name"* property of a built-in function object has the attributes { [[Writable]]: *false*, [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* }.</p>
  <p>Every other data property described in clauses <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref> through <emu-xref href="#sec-reflection"></emu-xref> and in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-additional-built-in-properties"></emu-xref> has the attributes { [[Writable]]: *true*, [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* } unless otherwise specified.</p>
  <p>Every accessor property described in clauses <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref> through <emu-xref href="#sec-reflection"></emu-xref> and in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-additional-built-in-properties"></emu-xref> has the attributes { [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* } unless otherwise specified. If only a get accessor function is described, the set accessor function is the default value, *undefined*. If only a set accessor is described the get accessor is the default value, *undefined*.</p>

        <h1>Time Values and Time Range</h1>
        <p>Time measurement in ECMAScript is analogous to time measurement in POSIX, in particular sharing definition in terms of the proleptic Gregorian calendar, an epoch of midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC, and an accounting of every day as comprising exactly 86,400 seconds (each of which is 1000 milliseconds long).</p>
        <p>An ECMAScript <dfn variants="time values">time value</dfn> is a Number, either a finite integral Number representing an instant in time to millisecond precision or *NaN* representing no specific instant. A time value that is a multiple of <emu-eqn>24 &times; 60 &times; 60 &times; 1000 = 86,400,000</emu-eqn> (i.e., is equal to 86,400,000 &times; _d_ for some integer _d_) represents the instant at the start of the UTC day that follows the epoch by _d_ whole UTC days (preceding the epoch for negative _d_). Every other finite time value _t_ is defined relative to the greatest preceding time value _s_ that is such a multiple, and represents the instant that occurs within the same UTC day as _s_ but follows it by _t_ &minus; _s_ milliseconds.</p>
        <p>Time values do not account for UTC leap seconds&mdash;there are no time values representing instants within positive leap seconds, and there are time values representing instants removed from the UTC timeline by negative leap seconds. However, the definition of time values nonetheless yields piecewise alignment with UTC, with discontinuities only at leap second boundaries and zero difference outside of leap seconds.</p>
        <p>A Number can exactly represent all integers from -9,007,199,254,740,992 to 9,007,199,254,740,992 (<emu-xref href="#sec-number.min_safe_integer"></emu-xref> and <emu-xref href="#sec-number.max_safe_integer"></emu-xref>). A time value supports a slightly smaller range of -8,640,000,000,000,000 to 8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds. This yields a supported time value range of exactly -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC.</p>
        <p>The exact moment of midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC is represented by the time value *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub>.</p>
        <emu-note>
          <p>The 400 year cycle of the proleptic Gregorian calendar contains 97 leap years. This yields an average of 365.2425 days per year, which is 31,556,952,000 milliseconds. Therefore, the maximum range a Number could represent exactly with millisecond precision is approximately -285,426 to 285,426 years relative to 1970. The smaller range supported by a time value as specified in this section is approximately -273,790 to 273,790 years relative to 1970.</p>

This means that the following two notations refer to exactly the same point in time: `1995-02-04T24:00` and `1995-02-05T00:00`. This interpretation of the latter form as "end of a calendar day" is consistent with ISO 8601, even though that specification reserves it for describing time intervals and does not permit it within representations of single points in time.</p>

          <h1>Expanded Years</h1>
          <p>Covering the full time value range of approximately 273,790 years forward or backward from 1 January 1970 (<emu-xref href="#sec-time-values-and-time-range"></emu-xref>) requires representing years before 0 or after 9999. ISO 8601 permits expansion of the year representation, but only by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange. In the simplified ECMAScript format, such an expanded year representation shall have 6 digits and is always prefixed with a + or - sign. The year 0 is considered positive and hence prefixed with a + sign. Strings matching the <emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format">Date Time String Format</emu-xref> with expanded years representing instants in time outside the range of a time value are treated as unrecognizable by <emu-xref href="#sec-date.parse">`Date.parse`</emu-xref> and cause that function to return *NaN* without falling back to implementation-specific behaviour or heuristics.</p>

        <p>The `parse` function applies the ToString operator to its argument. If ToString results in an abrupt completion the Completion Record is immediately returned. Otherwise, `parse` interprets the resulting String as a date and time; it returns a Number, the UTC time value corresponding to the date and time. The String may be interpreted as a local time, a UTC time, or a time in some other time zone, depending on the contents of the String. The function first attempts to parse the String according to the format described in Date Time String Format (<emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref>), including expanded years. If the String does not conform to that format the function may fall back to any implementation-specific heuristics or implementation-specific date formats.

        <p>If the String conforms to the <emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format">Date Time String Format</emu-xref>, substitute values take the place of absent format elements. When the `MM` or `DD` elements are absent, *"01"* is used. When the `HH`, `mm`, or `ss` elements are absent, *"00"* is used. When the `sss` element is absent, *"000"* is used.

        <p>An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402 Internationalization API must implement the `localeCompare` method as specified in the ECMA-402 specification. If an ECMAScript implementation does not include the ECMA-402 API the following specification of the `localeCompare` method is used.</p>
        <p>When the `localeCompare` method is called with argument _that_, it returns a Number other than *NaN* that represents the result of a locale-sensitive String comparison of the *this* value (converted to a String) with _that_ (converted to a String). The two Strings are _S_ and _That_. The two Strings are compared in an implementation-defined fashion. The result is intended to order String values in the sort order specified by a host default locale, and will be negative, zero, or positive, depending on whether _S_ comes before _That_ in the sort order, the Strings are equal, or _S_ comes after _That_ in the sort order, respectively.</p>
        <p>Before performing the comparisons, the following steps are performed to prepare the Strings:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Let _O_ be ? RequireObjectCoercible(*this* value).
          1. Let _S_ be ? ToString(_O_).
          1. Let _That_ be ? ToString(_that_).
        </emu-alg>
        <p>The meaning of the optional second and third parameters to this method are defined in the ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not include ECMA-402 support must not assign any other interpretation to those parameter positions.</p>
        <p>The `localeCompare` method, if considered as a function of two arguments *this* and _that_, is a consistent comparison function (as defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-array.prototype.sort"></emu-xref>) on the set of all Strings.</p>
        <p>The actual return values are implementation-defined to permit implementers to encode additional information in the value, but the function is required to define a total ordering on all Strings. This function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical and must return `0` when comparing Strings that are considered canonically equivalent.</p>
        <emu-note>
          <p>The `localeCompare` method itself is not directly suitable as an argument to `Array.prototype.sort` because the latter requires a function of two arguments.</p>
        </emu-note>
        <emu-note>
          <p>This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive comparison functionality is available to the ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare according to the rules of the host environment's current locale. However, regardless of the host provided comparison capabilities, this function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical. It is recommended that this function should not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or decompositions. For a definition and discussion of canonical equivalence see the Unicode Standard, chapters 2 and 3, as well as Unicode Standard Annex #15, Unicode Normalization Forms (<a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/</a>) and Unicode Technical Note #5, Canonical Equivalence in Applications (<a href="https://unicode.org/notes/tn5/">https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/</a>).

      <h1>Pattern Semantics</h1>
      <p>A regular expression pattern is converted into an Abstract Closure using the process described below. An implementation is encouraged to use more efficient algorithms than the ones listed below, as long as the results are the same. The Abstract Closure is used as the value of a RegExp object's [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot.</p>
      <p>A |Pattern| is either a BMP pattern or a Unicode pattern depending upon whether or not its associated flags contain a `u`. A BMP pattern matches against a String interpreted as consisting of a sequence of 16-bit values that are Unicode code points in the range of the Basic Multilingual Plane. A Unicode pattern matches against a String interpreted as consisting of Unicode code points encoded using UTF-16. In the context of describing the behaviour of a BMP pattern &ldquo;character&rdquo; means a single 16-bit Unicode BMP code point. In the context of describing the behaviour of a Unicode pattern &ldquo;character&rdquo; means a UTF-16 encoded code point (<emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type"></emu-xref>). In either context, &ldquo;character value&rdquo; means the numeric value of the corresponding non-encoded code point.</p>
      <p>The syntax and semantics of |Pattern| is defined as if the source text for the |Pattern| was a List of |SourceCharacter| values where each |SourceCharacter| corresponds to a Unicode code point. If a BMP pattern contains a non-BMP |SourceCharacter| the entire pattern is encoded using UTF-16 and the individual code units of that encoding are used as the elements of the List.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>For example, consider a pattern expressed in source text as the single non-BMP character U+1D11E (MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF). Interpreted as a Unicode pattern, it would be a single element (character) List consisting of the single code point 0x1D11E. However, interpreted as a BMP pattern, it is first UTF-16 encoded to produce a two element List consisting of the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E.</p>
        <p>Patterns are passed to the RegExp constructor as ECMAScript String values in which non-BMP characters are UTF-16 encoded. For example, the single character MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF pattern, expressed as a String value, is a String of length 2 whose elements were the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E. So no further translation of the string would be necessary to process it as a BMP pattern consisting of two pattern characters. However, to process it as a Unicode pattern UTF16SurrogatePairToCodePoint must be used in producing a List whose sole element is a single pattern character, the code point U+1D11E.</p>
        <p>An implementation may not actually perform such translations to or from UTF-16, but the semantics of this specification requires that the result of pattern matching be as if such translations were performed.</p>

            A <em>CharSet</em> is a mathematical set of characters. When the _Unicode_ flag is *true*, &ldquo;all characters&rdquo; means the CharSet containing all code point values; otherwise &ldquo;all characters&rdquo; means the CharSet containing all code unit values.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>State</em> is an ordered pair (_endIndex_, _captures_) where _endIndex_ is an integer and _captures_ is a List of _NcapturingParens_ values. States are used to represent partial match states in the regular expression matching algorithms. The _endIndex_ is one plus the index of the last input character matched so far by the pattern, while _captures_ holds the results of capturing parentheses. The _n_<sup>th</sup> element of _captures_ is either a List of characters that represents the value obtained by the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses or *undefined* if the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses hasn't been reached yet. Due to backtracking, many States may be in use at any time during the matching process.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>MatchResult</em> is either a State or the special token ~failure~ that indicates that the match failed.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>Continuation</em> is an Abstract Closure that takes one State argument and returns a MatchResult result. The Continuation attempts to match the remaining portion (specified by the closure's captured values) of the pattern against _Input_, starting at the intermediate state given by its State argument. If the match succeeds, the Continuation returns the final State that it reached; if the match fails, the Continuation returns ~failure~.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>Matcher</em> is an Abstract Closure that takes two arguments&mdash;a State and a Continuation&mdash;and returns a MatchResult result. A Matcher attempts to match a middle subpattern (specified by the closure's captured values) of the pattern against _Input_, starting at the intermediate state given by its State argument. The Continuation argument should be a closure that matches the rest of the pattern. After matching the subpattern of a pattern to obtain a new State, the Matcher then calls Continuation on that new State to test if the rest of the pattern can match as well. If it can, the Matcher returns the State returned by Continuation; if not, the Matcher may try different choices at its choice points, repeatedly calling Continuation until it either succeeds or all possibilities have been exhausted.

          <p>A Pattern compiles to an Abstract Closure value. RegExpBuiltinExec can then apply this procedure to a String and an offset within the String to determine whether the pattern would match starting at exactly that offset within the String, and, if it does match, what the values of the capturing parentheses would be. The algorithms in <emu-xref href="#sec-pattern-semantics"></emu-xref> are designed so that compiling a pattern may throw a *SyntaxError* exception; on the other hand, once the pattern is successfully compiled, applying the resulting Abstract Closure to find a match in a String cannot throw an exception (except for any implementation-defined exceptions that can occur anywhere such as out-of-memory).</p>

          <p>The `|` regular expression operator separates two alternatives. The pattern first tries to match the left |Alternative| (followed by the sequel of the regular expression); if it fails, it tries to match the right |Disjunction| (followed by the sequel of the regular expression).

If choices in the left |Alternative| are exhausted, the right |Disjunction| is tried instead of the left |Alternative|.

To inhibit the capturing behaviour of parentheses, use the form `(?:` |Disjunction| `)` instead.</p>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>The form `(?=` |Disjunction| `)` specifies a zero-width positive lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside |Disjunction| must match at the current position, but the current position is not advanced before matching the sequel. If |Disjunction| can match at the current position in several ways, only the first one is tried. Unlike other regular expression operators, there is no backtracking into a `(?=` form (this unusual behaviour is inherited from Perl). This only matters when the |Disjunction| contains capturing parentheses and the sequel of the pattern contains backreferences to those captures.</p>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(?=(a+))/.exec("baaabac")</code></pre>
            <p>matches the empty String immediately after the first `b` and therefore returns the array:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["", "aaa"]</code></pre>
            <p>To illustrate the lack of backtracking into the lookahead, consider:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(?=(a+))a*b\1/.exec("baaabac")</code></pre>
            <p>This expression returns</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["aba", "a"]</code></pre>
            <p>and not:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["aaaba", "a"]</code></pre>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>The form `(?!` |Disjunction| `)` specifies a zero-width negative lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside |Disjunction| must fail to match at the current position. The current position is not advanced before matching the sequel. |Disjunction| can contain capturing parentheses, but backreferences to them only make sense from within |Disjunction| itself. Backreferences to these capturing parentheses from elsewhere in the pattern always return *undefined* because the negative lookahead must fail for the pattern to succeed. For example,</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(.*?)a(?!(a+)b\2c)\2(.*)/.exec("baaabaac")</code></pre>
            <p>looks for an `a` not immediately followed by some positive number n of `a`'s, a `b`, another n `a`'s (specified by the first `\\2`) and a `c`. The second `\\2` is outside the negative lookahead, so it matches against *undefined* and therefore always succeeds. The whole expression returns the array:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["baaabaac", "ba", undefined, "abaac"]</code></pre>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>In case-insignificant matches when _Unicode_ is *true*, all characters are implicitly case-folded using the simple mapping provided by the Unicode standard immediately before they are compared. The simple mapping always maps to a single code point, so it does not map, for example, `&szlig;` (U+00DF) to `SS`. It may however map a code point outside the Basic Latin range to a character within, for example, `&#x17f;` (U+017F) to `s`. Such characters are not mapped if _Unicode_ is *false*. This prevents Unicode code points such as U+017F and U+212A from matching regular expressions such as `/[a-z]/i`, but they will match `/[a-z]/ui`.</p>

          <p>|ClassRanges| can expand into a single |ClassAtom| and/or ranges of two |ClassAtom| separated by dashes. In the latter case the |ClassRanges| includes all characters between the first |ClassAtom| and the second |ClassAtom|, inclusive; an error occurs if either |ClassAtom| does not represent a single character (for example, if one is \w) or if the first |ClassAtom|'s character value is greater than the second |ClassAtom|'s character value.</p>
        </emu-note>
        <emu-note>
          <p>Even if the pattern ignores case, the case of the two ends of a range is significant in determining which characters belong to the range. Thus, for example, the pattern `/[E-F]/i` matches only the letters `E`, `F`, `e`, and `f`, while the pattern `/[E-f]/i` matches all uppercase and lowercase letters in the Unicode Basic Latin block as well as the symbols `[`, `\\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, and <code>`</code>.</p>

The substrings are determined by searching from left to right for matches of the *this* value regular expression; these occurrences are not part of any String in the returned array, but serve to divide up the String value.</p>
          <p>The *this* value may be an empty regular expression or a regular expression that can match an empty String. In this case, the regular expression does not match the empty <emu-not-ref>substring</emu-not-ref> at the beginning or end of the input String, nor does it match the empty <emu-not-ref>substring</emu-not-ref> at the end of the previous separator match. (For example, if the regular expression matches the empty String, the String is split up into individual code unit elements; the length of the result array equals the length of the String, and each <emu-not-ref>substring</emu-not-ref> contains one code unit.) Only the first match at a given index of the String is considered, even if backtracking could yield a non-empty <emu-not-ref>substring</emu-not-ref> match at that index. (For example, `/a*?/[Symbol.split]("ab")` evaluates to the array `["a", "b"]`, while `/a*/[Symbol.split]("ab")` evaluates to the array `["","b"]`.)</p>
          <p>If _string_ is (or converts to) the empty String, the result depends on whether the regular expression can match the empty String. If it can, the result array contains no elements. Otherwise, the result array contains one element, which is the empty String.</p>

          <p>_callbackfn_ should be a function that takes four arguments. `reduce` calls the callback, as a function, once for each element after the first element present in the array, in ascending order.</p>
          <p>_callbackfn_ is called with four arguments: the _previousValue_ (value from the previous call to _callbackfn_), the _currentValue_ (value of the current element), the _currentIndex_, and the object being traversed. The first time that callback is called, the _previousValue_ and _currentValue_ can be one of two values. If an _initialValue_ was supplied in the call to `reduce`, then _previousValue_ will be equal to _initialValue_ and _currentValue_ will be equal to the first value in the array. If no _initialValue_ was supplied, then _previousValue_ will be equal to the first value in the array and _currentValue_ will be equal to the second. It is a *TypeError* if the array contains no elements and _initialValue_ is not provided.</p>
          <p>`reduce` does not directly mutate the object on which it is called but the object may be mutated by the calls to _callbackfn_.</p>
          <p>The range of elements processed by `reduce` is set before the first call to _callbackfn_. Elements that are appended to the array after the call to `reduce` begins will not be visited by _callbackfn_. If existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to _callbackfn_ will be the value at the time `reduce` visits them; elements that are deleted after the call to `reduce` begins and before being visited are not visited.</p>

Attempting to set the *"length"* property of an Array to a value that is numerically less than or equal to the largest numeric own property name of an existing non-configurable <emu-xref href="#array-index">array-indexed</emu-xref> property of the array will result in the length being set to a numeric value that is one greater than that non-configurable numeric own property name.

    <h1>WeakMap Objects</h1>
    <p>WeakMaps are collections of key/value pairs where the keys are objects and values may be arbitrary ECMAScript language values. A WeakMap may be queried to see if it contains a key/value pair with a specific key, but no mechanism is provided for enumerating the objects it holds as keys. In certain conditions, objects which are not live are removed as WeakMap keys, as described in <emu-xref href="#sec-weakref-execution"></emu-xref>.</p>
    <p>An implementation may impose an arbitrarily determined latency between the time a key/value pair of a WeakMap becomes inaccessible and the time when the key/value pair is removed from the WeakMap. If this latency was observable to ECMAScript program, it would be a source of indeterminacy that could impact program execution. For that reason, an ECMAScript implementation must not provide any means to observe a key of a WeakMap that does not require the observer to present the observed key.</p>
    <p>WeakMaps must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of key/value pairs in the collection. The data structure used in this specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of WeakMaps. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>WeakMap and WeakSets are intended to provide mechanisms for dynamically associating state with an object in a manner that does not &ldquo;leak&rdquo; memory resources if, in the absence of the WeakMap or WeakSet, the object otherwise became inaccessible and subject to resource reclamation by the implementation's garbage collection mechanisms. This characteristic can be achieved by using an inverted per-object mapping of weak map instances to keys. Alternatively each weak map may internally store its key to value mappings but this approach requires coordination between the WeakMap or WeakSet implementation and the garbage collector. The following references describe mechanism that may be useful to implementations of WeakMap and WeakSets:</p>

For that reason, an ECMAScript implementation must not provide any means to determine if a WeakSet contains a particular object that does not require the observer to present the observed object.</p>
    <p>WeakSets must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection. The data structure used in this specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of WeakSets. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.</p>

        <p>`Atomics.isLockFree`() is an optimization primitive. The intuition is that if the atomic step of an atomic primitive (`compareExchange`, `load`, `store`, `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, or `exchange`) on a datum of size _n_ bytes will be performed without the calling agent acquiring a lock outside the _n_ bytes comprising the datum, then `Atomics.isLockFree`(_n_) will return *true*. High-performance algorithms will use `Atomics.isLockFree` to determine whether to use locks or atomic operations in critical sections. If an atomic primitive is not lock-free then it is often more efficient for an algorithm to provide its own locking.</p>
        <p>`Atomics.isLockFree`(4) always returns *true* as that can be supported on all known relevant hardware. Being able to assume this will generally simplify programs.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the value of `Atomics.isLockFree`, all atomic operations are guaranteed to be atomic. For example, they will never have a visible operation take place in the middle of the operation (e.g., "tearing").</p>

      <p>The `stringify` function returns a String in UTF-16 encoded JSON format representing an ECMAScript language value, or *undefined*. It can take three parameters. The _value_ parameter is an ECMAScript language value, which is usually an object or array, although it can also be a String, Boolean, Number or *null*. The optional _replacer_ parameter is either a function that alters the way objects and arrays are stringified, or an array of Strings and Numbers that acts as an inclusion list for selecting the object properties that will be stringified. The optional _space_ parameter is a String or Number that allows the result to have white space injected into it to improve human readability.</p>
      <p>These are the steps in stringifying an object:</p>
      <emu-alg>

        <p>JSON structures are allowed to be nested to any depth, but they must be acyclic. If _value_ is or contains a cyclic structure, then the stringify function must throw a *TypeError* exception. This is an example of a value that cannot be stringified:</p>

        <p>Values that do not have a JSON representation (such as *undefined* and functions) do not produce a String. Instead they produce the *undefined* value.

    <h1>Promise Objects</h1>
    <p>A Promise is an object that is used as a placeholder for the eventual results of a deferred (and possibly asynchronous) computation.</p>
    <p>Any Promise is in one of three mutually exclusive states: <em>fulfilled</em>, <em>rejected</em>, and <em>pending</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A promise `p` is fulfilled if `p.then(f, r)` will immediately enqueue a Job to call the function `f`.
      </li>
      <li>
        A promise `p` is rejected if `p.then(f, r)` will immediately enqueue a Job to call the function `r`.
      </li>
      <li>
        A promise is pending if it is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A promise is said to be <em>settled</em> if it is not pending, i.e. if it is either fulfilled or rejected.</p>
    <p>A promise is <em>resolved</em> if it is settled or if it has been &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to match the state of another promise. Attempting to resolve or reject a resolved promise has no effect. A promise is <em>unresolved</em> if it is not resolved. An unresolved promise is always in the pending state. A resolved promise may be pending, fulfilled or rejected.</p>

            <li>When a promise is rejected without any handlers, it is called with its _operation_ argument set to *"reject"*.</li>
            <li>When a handler is added to a rejected promise for the first time, it is called with its _operation_ argument set to *"handle"*.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A typical implementation of HostPromiseRejectionTracker might try to notify developers of unhandled rejections, while also being careful to notify them if such previous notifications are later invalidated by new handlers being attached.</p>
        </emu-note>

        <emu-note>
          <p>If _operation_ is *"handle"*, an implementation should not hold a reference to _promise_ in a way that would interfere with garbage collection. An implementation may hold a reference to _promise_ if _operation_ is *"reject"*, since it is expected that rejections will be rare and not on hot code paths.</p>

The executor is called with two arguments: _resolve_ and _reject_. These are functions that may be used by the _executor_ function to report eventual completion or failure of the deferred computation.

The _executor_ code may eventually call the _resolve_ function to indicate that it wishes to resolve the associated Promise. The argument passed to the _resolve_ function represents the eventual value of the deferred action and can be either the actual fulfillment value or another promise which will provide the value if it is fulfilled.</p>
          <p>The _reject_ function that is passed to an _executor_ function accepts a single argument. The _executor_ code may eventually call the _reject_ function to indicate that the associated Promise is rejected and will never be fulfilled. The argument passed to the _reject_ function is used as the rejection value of the promise. Typically it will be an Error object.</p>
          <p>The resolve and reject functions passed to an _executor_ function by the Promise constructor have the capability to actually resolve and reject the associated promise. Subclasses may have different constructor behaviour that passes in customized values for resolve and reject.</p>

  <h1>Memory Model</h1>
  <p>The memory consistency model, or <dfn>memory model</dfn>, specifies the possible orderings of Shared Data Block events, arising via accessing TypedArray instances backed by a SharedArrayBuffer and via methods on the Atomics object. When the program has no data races (defined below), the ordering of events appears as sequentially consistent, i.e., as an interleaving of actions from each agent. When the program has data races, shared memory operations may appear sequentially inconsistent. For example, programs may exhibit causality-violating behaviour and other astonishments. These astonishments arise from compiler transforms and the design of CPUs (e.g., out-of-order execution and speculation). The memory model defines both the precise conditions under which a program exhibits sequentially consistent behaviour as well as the possible values read from data races. To wit, there is no undefined behaviour.</p>
  <p>The memory model is defined as relational constraints on events introduced by abstract operations on SharedArrayBuffer or by methods on the Atomics object during an evaluation.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>This section provides an axiomatic model on events introduced by the abstract operations on SharedArrayBuffers. It bears stressing that the model is not expressible algorithmically, unlike the rest of this specification. The nondeterministic introduction of events by abstract operations is the interface between the operational semantics of ECMAScript evaluation and the axiomatic semantics of the memory model. The semantics of these events is defined by considering graphs of all events in an evaluation. These are neither Static Semantics nor Runtime Semantics. There is no demonstrated algorithmic implementation, but instead a set of constraints that determine if a particular event graph is allowed or disallowed.</p>

    <p>Shared memory accesses (reads and writes) are divided into two groups, atomic accesses and data accesses, defined below.

Non-atomic accesses do not have a strict total ordering agreed upon by all agents, i.e., unordered.</p>

    <p>Some operations may also introduce <dfn>Synchronize</dfn> events. A <dfn variants="Synchronize events">Synchronize event</dfn> has no fields, and exists purely to directly constrain the permitted orderings of other events.</p>
    <p>In addition to Shared Data Block and Synchronize events, there are host-specific events.</p>
    <p>Let the range of a ReadSharedMemory, WriteSharedMemory, or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory event be the Set of contiguous integers from its [[ByteIndex]] to [[ByteIndex]] + [[ElementSize]] - 1. Two events' ranges are equal when the events have the same [[Block]], and the ranges are element-wise equal. Two events' ranges are overlapping when the events have the same [[Block]], the ranges are not equal and their intersection is non-empty. Two events' ranges are disjoint when the events do not have the same [[Block]] or their ranges are neither equal nor overlapping.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>Examples of host-specific synchronizing events that should be accounted for are: sending a SharedArrayBuffer from one agent to another (e.g., by `postMessage` in a browser), starting and stopping agents, and communicating within the agent cluster via channels other than shared memory. It is assumed those events are appended to agent-order during evaluation like the other SharedArrayBuffer events.</p>

    <h1>Shared Memory Guidelines</h1>
    <emu-note>
      <p>The following are guidelines for ECMAScript programmers working with shared memory.</p>
      <p>We recommend programs be kept data race free, i.e., make it so that it is impossible for there to be concurrent non-atomic operations on the same memory location. Data race free programs have interleaving semantics where each step in the evaluation semantics of each agent are interleaved with each other. For data race free programs, it is not necessary to understand the details of the memory model. The details are unlikely to build intuition that will help one to better write ECMAScript.</p>
      <p>More generally, even if a program is not data race free it may have predictable behaviour, so long as atomic operations are not involved in any data races and the operations that race all have the same access size. The simplest way to arrange for atomics not to be involved in races is to ensure that different memory cells are used by atomic and non-atomic operations and that atomic accesses of different sizes are not used to access the same cells at the same time. Effectively, the program should treat shared memory as strongly typed as much as possible. One still cannot depend on the ordering and timing of non-atomic accesses that race, but if memory is treated as strongly typed the racing accesses will not "tear" (bits of their values will not be mixed).</p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The following are guidelines for ECMAScript implementers writing compiler transformations for programs using shared memory.</p>
      <p>It is desirable to allow most program transformations that are valid in a single-agent setting in a multi-agent setting, to ensure that the performance of each agent in a multi-agent program is as good as it would be in a single-agent setting. Frequently these transformations are hard to judge. We outline some rules about program transformations that are intended to be taken as normative (in that they are implied by the memory model or stronger than what the memory model implies) but which are likely not exhaustive. These rules are intended to apply to program transformations that precede the introductions of the events that make up the agent-order.</p>
      <p>Let an <dfn variants="agent-order slices">agent-order slice</dfn> be the subset of the agent-order pertaining to a single agent.</p>
      <p>Let <dfn>possible read values</dfn> of a read event be the set of all values of ValueOfReadEvent for that event across all valid executions.</p>
      <p>Any transformation of an agent-order slice that is valid in the absence of shared memory is valid in the presence of shared memory, with the following exceptions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><em>Atomics are carved in stone</em>: Program transformations must not cause the ~SeqCst~ events in an agent-order slice to be reordered with its ~Unordered~ operations, nor its ~SeqCst~ operations to be reordered with each other, nor may a program transformation remove a ~SeqCst~ operation from the agent-order.</p>
          <p>(In practice, the prohibition on reorderings forces a compiler to assume that every ~SeqCst~ operation is a synchronization and included in the final memory-order, which it would usually have to assume anyway in the absence of inter-agent program analysis. It also forces the compiler to assume that every call where the callee's effects on the memory-order are unknown may contain ~SeqCst~ operations.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Reads must be stable</em>: Any given shared memory read must only observe a single value in an execution.</p>
          <p>(For example, if what is semantically a single read in the program is executed multiple times then the program is subsequently allowed to observe only one of the values read. A transformation known as rematerialization can violate this rule.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Writes must be stable</em>: All observable writes to shared memory must follow from program semantics in an execution.</p>
          <p>(For example, a transformation may not introduce certain observable writes, such as by using read-modify-write operations on a larger location to write a smaller datum, writing a value to memory that the program could not have written, or writing a just-read value back to the location it was read from, if that location could have been overwritten by another agent after the read.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><em>Possible read values must be nonempty</em>: Program transformations cannot cause the possible read values of a shared memory read to become empty.</p>
          <p>(Counterintuitively, this rule in effect restricts transformations on writes, because writes have force in memory model insofar as to be read by read events. For example, writes may be moved and coalesced and sometimes reordered between two ~SeqCst~ operations, but the transformation may not remove every write that updates a location; some write must be preserved.)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of transformations that remain valid are: merging multiple non-atomic reads from the same location, reordering non-atomic reads, introducing speculative non-atomic reads, merging multiple non-atomic writes to the same location, reordering non-atomic writes to different locations, and hoisting non-atomic reads out of loops even if that affects termination. Note in general that aliased TypedArrays make it hard to prove that locations are different.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The following are guidelines for ECMAScript implementers generating machine code for shared memory accesses.</p>
      <p>For architectures with memory models no weaker than those of ARM or Power, non-atomic stores and loads may be compiled to bare stores and loads on the target architecture. Atomic stores and loads may be compiled down to instructions that guarantee sequential consistency. If no such instructions exist, memory barriers are to be employed, such as placing barriers on both sides of a bare store or load. Read-modify-write operations may be compiled to read-modify-write instructions on the target architecture, such as <code>LOCK</code>-prefixed instructions on x86, load-exclusive/store-exclusive instructions on ARM, and load-link/store-conditional instructions on Power.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the memory model is intended to allow code generation as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every atomic operation in the program is assumed to be necessary.</li>
        <li>Atomic operations are never rearranged with each other or with non-atomic operations.</li>
        <li>Functions are always assumed to perform atomic operations.</li>
        <li>Atomic operations are never implemented as read-modify-write operations on larger data, but as non-lock-free atomics if the platform does not have atomic operations of the appropriate size. (We already assume that every platform has normal memory access operations of every interesting size.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Naive code generation uses these patterns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular loads and stores compile to single load and store instructions.</li>
        <li>Lock-free atomic loads and stores compile to a full (sequentially consistent) fence, a regular load or store, and a full fence.</li>
        <li>Lock-free atomic read-modify-write accesses compile to a full fence, an atomic read-modify-write instruction sequence, and a full fence.</li>
        <li>Non-lock-free atomics compile to a spinlock acquire, a full fence, a series of non-atomic load and store instructions, a full fence, and a spinlock release.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That mapping is correct so long as an atomic operation on an address range does not race with a non-atomic write or with an atomic operation of different size. However, that is all we need: the memory model effectively demotes the atomic operations involved in a race to non-atomic status. On the other hand, the naive mapping is quite strong: it allows atomic operations to be used as sequentially consistent fences, which the memory model does not actually guarantee.</p>
      <p>A number of local improvements to those basic patterns are also intended to be legal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are obvious platform-dependent improvements that remove redundant fences. For example, on x86 the fences around lock-free atomic loads and stores can always be omitted except for the fence following a store, and no fence is needed for lock-free read-modify-write instructions, as these all use <code>LOCK</code>-prefixed instructions. On many platforms there are fences of several strengths, and weaker fences can be used in certain contexts without destroying sequential consistency.</li>
        <li>Most modern platforms support lock-free atomics for all the data sizes required by ECMAScript atomics. Should non-lock-free atomics be needed, the fences surrounding the body of the atomic operation can usually be folded into the lock and unlock steps. The simplest solution for non-lock-free atomics is to have a single lock word per SharedArrayBuffer.</li>
        <li>There are also more complicated platform-dependent local improvements, requiring some code analysis. For example, two back-to-back fences often have the same effect as a single fence, so if code is generated for two atomic operations in sequence, only a single fence need separate them. On x86, even a single fence separating atomic stores can be omitted, as the fence following a store is only needed to separate the store from a subsequent load.</li>
      </ul>

  <h1>Additional ECMAScript Features for Web Browsers</h1>
  <p>The ECMAScript language syntax and semantics defined in this annex are required when the ECMAScript host is a web browser. The content of this annex is normative but optional if the ECMAScript host is not a web browser.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>This annex describes various legacy features and other characteristics of web browser ECMAScript hosts. All of the language features and behaviours specified in this annex have one or more undesirable characteristics and in the absence of legacy usage would be removed from this specification. However, the usage of these features by large numbers of existing web pages means that web browsers must continue to support them. The specifications in this annex define the requirements for interoperable implementations of these legacy features.</p>
    <p>These features are not considered part of the core ECMAScript language. Programmers should not use or assume the existence of these features and behaviours when writing new ECMAScript code. ECMAScript implementations are discouraged from implementing these features unless the implementation is part of a web browser or is required to run the same legacy ECMAScript code that web browsers encounter.</p>

      <p>This alternative pattern grammar and semantics only changes the syntax and semantics of BMP patterns.

      <h1>Labelled Function Declarations</h1>
      <p>Prior to ECMAScript 2015, the specification of |LabelledStatement| did not allow for the association of a statement label with a |FunctionDeclaration|. However, a labelled |FunctionDeclaration| was an allowable extension for non-strict code and most browser-hosted ECMAScript implementations supported that extension. In ECMAScript 2015 and later, the grammar production for |LabelledStatement| permits use of |FunctionDeclaration| as a |LabelledItem| but <emu-xref href="#sec-labelled-statements-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref> includes an Early Error rule that produces a Syntax Error if that occurs. That rule is modified with the addition of the <ins>highlighted</ins> text:</p>
      <emu-grammar>LabelledItem : FunctionDeclaration</emu-grammar>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is a Syntax Error if any source text <ins>that is strict mode code</ins> is matched by this production.

      </ul>

      <h1>Block-Level Function Declarations Web Legacy Compatibility Semantics</h1>
      <p>Prior to ECMAScript 2015, the ECMAScript specification did not define the occurrence of a |FunctionDeclaration| as an element of a |Block| statement's |StatementList|. However, support for that form of |FunctionDeclaration| was an allowable extension and most browser-hosted ECMAScript implementations permitted them. Unfortunately, the semantics of such declarations differ among those implementations. Because of these semantic differences, existing web ECMAScript code that uses |Block| level function declarations is only portable among browser implementations if the usage only depends upon the semantic intersection of all of the browser implementations for such declarations. The following are the use cases that fall within that intersection semantics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>A function is declared and only referenced within a single block.</p>
          <ul>

              One or more |FunctionDeclaration|s whose |BindingIdentifier| is the name _f_ occur within the function code of an enclosing function _g_ and that declaration is nested within a |Block|.
            </li>
            <li>
              No other declaration of _f_ that is not a `var` declaration occurs within the function code of _g_.
            </li>
            <li>
              All occurrences of _f_ as an |IdentifierReference| are within the |StatementList| of the |Block| containing the declaration of _f_.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A function is declared and possibly used within a single |Block| but also referenced by an inner function definition that is not contained within that same |Block|.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One or more |FunctionDeclaration|s whose |BindingIdentifier| is the name _f_ occur within the function code of an enclosing function _g_ and that declaration is nested within a |Block|.
            </li>
            <li>
              No other declaration of _f_ that is not a `var` declaration occurs within the function code of _g_.
            </li>
            <li>
              There may be occurrences of _f_ as an |IdentifierReference| within the |StatementList| of the |Block| containing the declaration of _f_.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is at least one occurrence of _f_ as an |IdentifierReference| within another function _h_ that is nested within _g_ and no other declaration of _f_ shadows the references to _f_ from within _h_.
            </li>
            <li>
              All invocations of _h_ occur after the declaration of _f_ has been evaluated.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A function is declared and possibly used within a single block but also referenced within subsequent blocks.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One or more |FunctionDeclaration| whose |BindingIdentifier| is the name _f_ occur within the function code of an enclosing function _g_ and that declaration is nested within a |Block|.
            </li>
            <li>
              No other declaration of _f_ that is not a `var` declaration occurs within the function code of _g_.
            </li>
            <li>
              There may be occurrences of _f_ as an |IdentifierReference| within the |StatementList| of the |Block| containing the declaration of _f_.

            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first use case is interoperable with the semantics of |Block| level function declarations provided by ECMAScript 2015. Any pre-existing ECMAScript code that employs that use case will operate using the Block level function declarations semantics defined by clauses <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-and-exotic-objects-behaviours"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations"></emu-xref>, and <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-functions-and-classes"></emu-xref>.</p>
      <p>ECMAScript 2015 interoperability for the second and third use cases requires the following extensions to the clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-and-exotic-objects-behaviours"></emu-xref>, clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-functions-and-classes"></emu-xref>, clause <emu-xref href="#sec-eval-x"></emu-xref> and clause <emu-xref href="#sec-globaldeclarationinstantiation"></emu-xref> semantics.</p>
      <p>If an ECMAScript implementation has a mechanism for reporting diagnostic warning messages, a warning should be produced when code contains a |FunctionDeclaration| for which these compatibility semantics are applied and introduce observable differences from non-compatibility semantics. For example, if a var binding is not introduced because its introduction would create an early error, a warning message should not be produced.</p>

      Arguments objects for strict functions do not dynamically share their <emu-xref href="#array-index">array-indexed</emu-xref> property values with the corresponding formal parameter bindings of their functions. (<emu-xref href="#sec-arguments-exotic-objects"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      For strict functions, if an arguments object is created the binding of the local identifier `arguments` to the arguments object is immutable and hence may not be the target of an assignment expression. (<emu-xref href="#sec-functiondeclarationinstantiation"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      It is a *SyntaxError* if the StringValue of a |BindingIdentifier| is *"eval"* or *"arguments"* within strict mode code (<emu-xref href="#sec-identifiers-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Strict mode eval code cannot instantiate variables or functions in the variable environment of the caller to eval. Instead, a new variable environment is created and that environment is used for declaration binding instantiation for the eval code (<emu-xref href="#sec-eval-x"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      If *this* is evaluated within strict mode code, then the *this* value is not coerced to an object. A *this* value of *undefined* or *null* is not converted to the global object and primitive values are not converted to wrapper objects. The *this* value passed via a function call (including calls made using `Function.prototype.apply` and `Function.prototype.call`) do not coerce the passed *this* value to an object (<emu-xref href="#sec-ordinarycallbindthis"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-function.prototype.apply"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-function.prototype.call"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      When a `delete` operator occurs within strict mode code, a *SyntaxError* is thrown if its |UnaryExpression| is a direct reference to a variable, function argument, or function name (<emu-xref href="#sec-delete-operator-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      When a `delete` operator occurs within strict mode code, a *TypeError* is thrown if the property to be deleted has the attribute { [[Configurable]]: *false* } or otherwise cannot be deleted (<emu-xref href="#sec-delete-operator-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Strict mode code may not include a |WithStatement|. The occurrence of a |WithStatement| in such a context is a *SyntaxError* (<emu-xref href="#sec-with-statement-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      It is a *SyntaxError* if a |CatchParameter| occurs within strict mode code and BoundNames of |CatchParameter| contains either `eval` or `arguments` (<emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      It is a *SyntaxError* if the same |BindingIdentifier| appears more than once in the |FormalParameters| of a strict function. An attempt to create such a function using a Function, Generator, or AsyncFunction constructor is a *SyntaxError* (<emu-xref href="#sec-function-definitions-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-createdynamicfunction"></emu-xref>).
    </li>
    <li>
      An implementation may not extend, beyond that defined in this specification, the meanings within strict functions of properties named *"caller"* or *"arguments"* of function instances.

<emu-annex id="sec-corrections-and-clarifications-in-ecmascript-2015-with-possible-compatibility-impact">
  <h1>Corrections and Clarifications in ECMAScript 2015 with Possible Compatibility Impact</h1>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-candeclareglobalvar"></emu-xref>-<emu-xref href="#sec-createglobalfunctionbinding"></emu-xref> Edition 5 and 5.1 used a property existence test to determine whether a global object property corresponding to a new global declaration already existed. ECMAScript 2015 uses an own property existence test. This corresponds to what has been most commonly implemented by web browsers.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-array-exotic-objects-defineownproperty-p-desc"></emu-xref>: The 5<sup>th</sup> Edition moved the capture of the current array length prior to the integer conversion of the array index or new length value. However, the captured length value could become invalid if the conversion process has the side-effect of changing the array length. ECMAScript 2015 specifies that the current array length must be captured after the possible occurrence of such side-effects.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-timeclip"></emu-xref>: Previous editions permitted the TimeClip abstract operation to return either *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> or *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub> as the representation of a 0 time value. ECMAScript 2015 specifies that *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> always returned. This means that for ECMAScript 2015 the time value of a Date is never observably *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub> and methods that return time values never return *-0*<sub>𝔽</sub>.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref>: If a UTC offset representation is not present, the local time zone is used. Edition 5.1 incorrectly stated that a missing time zone should be interpreted as *"z"*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-date.prototype.toisostring"></emu-xref>: If the year cannot be represented using the Date Time String Format specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref> a RangeError exception is thrown. Previous editions did not specify the behaviour for that case.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-date.prototype.tostring"></emu-xref>: Previous editions did not specify the value returned by `Date.prototype.toString` when this time value is *NaN*. ECMAScript 2015 specifies the result to be the String value *"Invalid Date"*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-pattern-flags"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-escaperegexppattern"></emu-xref>: Any LineTerminator code points in the value of the *"source"* property of a RegExp instance must be expressed using an escape sequence. Edition 5.1 only required the escaping of `/`.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-regexp.prototype-@@match"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-regexp.prototype-@@replace"></emu-xref>: In previous editions, the specifications for `String.prototype.match` and `String.prototype.replace` was incorrect for cases where the pattern argument was a RegExp value whose `global` flag is set. The previous specifications stated that for each attempt to match the pattern, if `lastIndex` did not change it should be incremented by 1. The correct behaviour is that `lastIndex` should be incremented by one only if the pattern matched the empty String.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-array.prototype.sort"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-sortcompare"></emu-xref>: Previous editions did not specify how a *NaN* value returned by a _comparefn_ was interpreted by `Array.prototype.sort`. ECMAScript 2015 specifies that such as value is treated as if *+0*<sub>𝔽</sub> was returned from the _comparefn_. ECMAScript 2015 also specifies that ToNumber is applied to the result returned by a _comparefn_. In previous editions, the effect of a _comparefn_ result that is not a Number value was implementation-defined. In practice, implementations call ToNumber.</p>
</emu-annex>

<emu-annex id="sec-additions-and-changes-that-introduce-incompatibilities-with-prior-editions">
  <h1>Additions and Changes That Introduce Incompatibilities with Prior Editions</h1>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-reference-record-specification-type"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, Function calls are not allowed to return a Reference Record.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-tonumber-applied-to-the-string-type"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, ToNumber applied to a String value now recognizes and converts |BinaryIntegerLiteral| and |OctalIntegerLiteral| numeric strings. In previous editions such strings were converted to *NaN*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-code-realms"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2018, Template objects are canonicalized based on Parse Node (source location), instead of across all occurrences of that template literal or tagged template in a Realm in previous editions.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-white-space"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2016, Unicode 8.0.0 or higher is mandated, as opposed to ECMAScript 2015 which mandated Unicode 5.1. In particular, this caused U+180E MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR, which was in the `Space_Separator` (`Zs`) category and thus treated as whitespace in ECMAScript 2015, to be moved to the `Format` (`Cf`) category (as of Unicode 6.3.0). This causes whitespace-sensitive methods to behave differently. For example, `"\u180E".trim().length` was `0` in previous editions, but `1` in ECMAScript 2016 and later. Additionally, ECMAScript 2017 mandated always using the latest version of the Unicode standard.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-names-and-keywords"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the valid code points for an |IdentifierName| are specified in terms of the Unicode properties &ldquo;ID_Start&rdquo; and &ldquo;ID_Continue&rdquo;. In previous editions, the valid |IdentifierName| or |Identifier| code points were specified by enumerating various Unicode code point categories.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-rules-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, Automatic Semicolon Insertion adds a semicolon at the end of a do-while statement if the semicolon is missing. This change aligns the specification with the actual behaviour of most existing implementations.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object-initializer-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, it is no longer an early error to have duplicate property names in Object Initializers.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-assignment-operators-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, strict mode code containing an assignment to an immutable binding such as the function name of a |FunctionExpression| does not produce an early error. Instead it produces a runtime error.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-block"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, a |StatementList| beginning with the token let followed by the input elements |LineTerminator| then |Identifier| is the start of a |LexicalDeclaration|. In previous editions, automatic semicolon insertion would always insert a semicolon before the |Identifier| input element.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-expression-statement"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, a |StatementListItem| beginning with the token `let` followed by the token `[` is the start of a |LexicalDeclaration|. In previous editions such a sequence would be the start of an |ExpressionStatement|.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-if-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the normal completion value of an |IfStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If no |Statement| part is evaluated or if the evaluated |Statement| part produces a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |IfStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the `(` token of a for statement is immediately followed by the token sequence `let [` then the `let` is treated as the start of a |LexicalDeclaration|. In previous editions such a token sequence would be the start of an |Expression|.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the ( token of a for-in statement is immediately followed by the token sequence `let [` then the `let` is treated as the start of a |ForDeclaration|. In previous editions such a token sequence would be the start of an |LeftHandSideExpression|.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: Prior to ECMAScript 2015, an initialization expression could appear as part of the |VariableDeclaration| that precedes the `in` keyword. In ECMAScript 2015, the |ForBinding| in that same position does not allow the occurrence of such an initializer. In ECMAScript 2017, such an initializer is permitted only in non-strict code.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the completion value of an |IterationStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If the |Statement| part of an |IterationStatement| is not evaluated or if the final evaluation of the |Statement| part produces a completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |IterationStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-with-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the normal completion value of a |WithStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If evaluation of the |Statement| part of a |WithStatement| produces a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |WithStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-switch-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the completion value of a |SwitchStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If the |CaseBlock| part of a |SwitchStatement| produces a completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |SwitchStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, it is an early error for a |Catch| clause to contain a `var` declaration for the same |Identifier| that appears as the |Catch| clause parameter. In previous editions, such a variable declaration would be instantiated in the enclosing variable environment but the declaration's |Initializer| value would be assigned to the |Catch| parameter.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-evaldeclarationinstantiation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, a runtime *SyntaxError* is thrown if a |Catch| clause evaluates a non-strict direct `eval` whose eval code includes a `var` or `FunctionDeclaration` declaration that binds the same |Identifier| that appears as the |Catch| clause parameter.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the completion value of a |TryStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If the |Block| part of a |TryStatement| evaluates to a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |TryStatement| is *undefined*. If the |Block| part of a |TryStatement| evaluates to a throw completion and it has a |Catch| part that evaluates to a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |TryStatement| is *undefined* if there is no |Finally| clause or if its |Finally| clause evaluates to an ~empty~ normal completion.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-runtime-semantics-methoddefinitionevaluation"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the function objects that are created as the values of the [[Get]] or [[Set]] attribute of accessor properties in an |ObjectLiteral| are not constructor functions and they do not have a *"prototype"* own property. In the previous edition, they were constructors and had a *"prototype"* property.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.freeze"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.freeze` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.getownpropertydescriptor"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.getownpropertynames"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.getprototypeof"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.getPrototypeOf` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.isextensible"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.isExtensible` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.isfrozen"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.isFrozen` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.issealed"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.isSealed` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.keys"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.keys` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.preventextensions"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.preventExtensions` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.seal"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.seal` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-function.prototype.bind"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a bound function is set to the [[GetPrototypeOf]] value of its target function. In the previous edition, [[Prototype]] was always set to %Function.prototype%.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-function-instances-length"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the *"length"* property of function instances is configurable. In previous editions it was non-configurable.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-nativeerror-constructors"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a _NativeError_ constructor is the Error constructor. In previous editions it was the Function prototype object.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-date-prototype-object"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the Date prototype object is not a Date instance. In previous editions it was a Date instance whose TimeValue was *NaN*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.localecompare"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the `String.prototype.localeCompare` function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as being identical. In previous editions implementations were permitted to ignore canonical equivalence and could instead use a bit-wise comparison.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.tolowercase"></emu-xref> and <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.touppercase"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, lowercase/upper conversion processing operates on code points. In previous editions such the conversion processing was only applied to individual code units. The only affected code points are those in the Deseret block of Unicode.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.trim"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the `String.prototype.trim` method is defined to recognize white space code points that may exist outside of the Unicode BMP. However, as of Unicode 7 no such code points are defined. In previous editions such code points would not have been recognized as white space.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-pattern-flags"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, If the _pattern_ argument is a RegExp instance and the _flags_ argument is not *undefined*, a new RegExp instance is created just like _pattern_ except that _pattern_'s flags are replaced by the argument _flags_. In previous editions a *TypeError* exception was thrown when _pattern_ was a RegExp instance and _flags_ was not *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-regexp-prototype-object"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the RegExp prototype object is not a RegExp instance. In previous editions it was a RegExp instance whose pattern is the empty String.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-regexp-prototype-object"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, *"source"*, *"global"*, *"ignoreCase"*, and *"multiline"* are accessor properties defined on the RegExp prototype object. In previous editions they were data properties defined on RegExp instances.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-atomics.notify"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2019, `Atomics.wake` has been renamed to `Atomics.notify` to prevent confusion with `Atomics.wait`.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-asyncfromsynciteratorcontinuation"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-asyncgeneratorresume"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2019, the number of Jobs enqueued by `await` was reduced, which could create an observable difference in resolution order between a `then()` call and an `await` expression.</p>
