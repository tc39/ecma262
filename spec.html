<emu-intro>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2017 Language. It is the eighth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.</p>
  <p>The development of the ECMAScript Language Specification started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.</p>
  <p>That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.</p>
  <p>The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.</p>
  <p>After publication of the third edition, ECMAScript achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. However, that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript but some of it was incorporated into the development of the sixth edition.</p>
  <p>The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5<sup>th</sup> edition) codified de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and added support for new features that had emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. The Fifth Edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 2009.</p>
  <p>The fifth Edition was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262:2011. Edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard incorporated minor corrections and is the same text as ISO/IEC 16262:2011. The 5.1 Edition was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 2011.</p>
  <p>Focused development of the sixth edition started in 2009, as the fifth edition was being prepared for publication. However, this was preceded by significant experimentation and language enhancement design efforts dating to the publication of the third edition in 1999. In a very real sense, the completion of the sixth edition is the culmination of a fifteen year effort. The goals for this addition included providing better support for large applications, library creation, and for use of ECMAScript as a compilation target for other languages. Some of its major enhancements included modules, class declarations, lexical block scoping, iterators and generators, promises for asynchronous programming, destructuring patterns, and proper tail calls. The ECMAScript library of built-ins was expanded to support additional data abstractions including maps, sets, and arrays of binary numeric values as well as additional support for Unicode supplemental characters in strings and regular expressions. The built-ins were also made extensible via subclassing. The sixth edition provides the foundation for regular, incremental language and library enhancements. The sixth edition was adopted by the General Assembly of June 2015.</p>
  <p>This ECMAScript specification is the first ECMAScript edition released under Ecma TC39's new yearly release cadence and open development process. A plain-text source document was built from the ECMAScript 2015 source document to serve as the base for further development entirely on GitHub. Over the year of this standard's development, hundreds of pull requests and issues were filed representing thousands of bug fixes, editorial fixes and other improvements. Additionally, numerous software tools were developed to aid in this effort including Ecmarkup, Ecmarkdown, and Grammarkdown. This specification also includes support for a new exponentiation operator and adds a new method to Array.prototype called `includes`.</p>
  <p>Dozens of individuals representing many organizations have made very significant contributions within Ecma TC39 to the development of this edition and to the prior editions. In addition, a vibrant community has emerged supporting TC39's ECMAScript efforts. This community has reviewed numerous drafts, filed thousands of bug reports, performed implementation experiments, contributed test suites, and educated the world-wide developer community about ECMAScript. Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify and acknowledge every person and organization who has contributed to this effort.</p>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>This section contains a non-normative overview of the ECMAScript language.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be used as a scripting language, but has become widely used as a general purpose programming language. A <em>scripting language</em> is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. In such systems, useful functionality is already available through a user interface, and the scripting language is a mechanism for exposing that functionality to program control. In this way, the existing system is said to provide a host environment of objects and facilities, which completes the capabilities of the scripting language. A scripting language is intended for use by both professional and non-professional programmers.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript was originally designed to be a <em>Web scripting language</em>, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture. ECMAScript is now used to provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host environments. Therefore the core language is specified in this document apart from any particular host environment.</p>
  <p>ECMAScript usage has moved beyond simple scripting and it is now used for the full spectrum of programming tasks in many different environments and scales. As the usage of ECMAScript has expanded, so has the features and facilities it provides. ECMAScript is now a fully featured general propose programming language.</p>
  <p>Some of the facilities of ECMAScript are similar to those used in other programming languages; in particular C, Java&trade;, Self, and Scheme as described in:</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-web-scripting">
    <h1>Web Scripting</h1>
    <p>A web browser provides an ECMAScript host environment for client-side computation including, for instance, objects that represent windows, menus, pop-ups, dialog boxes, text areas, anchors, frames, history, cookies, and input/output. Further, the host environment provides a means to attach scripting code to events such as change of focus, page and image loading, unloading, error and abort, selection, form submission, and mouse actions. Scripting code appears within the HTML and the displayed page is a combination of user interface elements and fixed and computed text and images. The scripting code is reactive to user interaction and there is no need for a main program.</p>
    <p>A web server provides a different host environment for server-side computation including objects representing requests, clients, and files; and mechanisms to lock and share data. By using browser-side and server-side scripting together, it is possible to distribute computation between the client and server while providing a customized user interface for a Web-based application.</p>
    <p>Each Web browser and server that supports ECMAScript supplies its own host environment, completing the ECMAScript execution environment.</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-overview">
    <h1>ECMAScript Overview</h1>
    <p>The following is an informal overview of ECMAScript&mdash;not all parts of the language are described. This overview is not part of the standard proper.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript is object-based: basic language and host facilities are provided by objects, and an ECMAScript program is a cluster of communicating objects. In ECMAScript, an <em>object</em> is a collection of zero or more <em>properties</em> each with <em>attributes</em> that determine how each property can be used&mdash;for example, when the Writable attribute for a property is set to *false*, any attempt by executed ECMAScript code to assign a different value to the property fails. Properties are containers that hold other objects, <em>primitive values</em>, or <em>functions</em>. A primitive value is a member of one of the following built-in types: <b>Undefined</b>, <b>Null</b>, <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Number</b>, <b>String</b>, and <b>Symbol;</b> an object is a member of the built-in type <b>Object</b>; and a function is a callable object. A function that is associated with an object via a property is called a <em>method</em>.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript defines a collection of <em>built-in objects</em> that round out the definition of ECMAScript entities. These built-in objects include the global object; objects that are fundamental to the runtime semantics of the language including `Object`, `Function`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, and various `Error` objects; objects that represent and manipulate numeric values including `Math`, `Number`, and `Date`; the text processing objects `String` and `RegExp`; objects that are indexed collections of values including `Array` and nine different kinds of Typed Arrays whose elements all have a specific numeric data representation; keyed collections including `Map` and `Set` objects; objects supporting structured data including the `JSON` object, `ArrayBuffer`, and `DataView`; objects supporting control abstractions including generator functions and `Promise` objects; and, reflection objects including `Proxy` and `Reflect`.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript also defines a set of built-in <em>operators</em>. ECMAScript operators include various unary operations, multiplicative operators, additive operators, bitwise shift operators, relational operators, equality operators, binary bitwise operators, binary logical operators, assignment operators, and the comma operator.</p>
    <p>Large ECMAScript programs are supported by <em>modules</em> which allow a program to be divided into multiple sequences of statements and declarations. Each module explicitly identifies declarations it uses that need to be provided by other modules and which of its declarations are available for use by other modules.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript syntax intentionally resembles Java syntax. ECMAScript syntax is relaxed to enable it to serve as an easy-to-use scripting language. For example, a variable is not required to have its type declared nor are types associated with properties, and defined functions are not required to have their declarations appear textually before calls to them.</p>

    <!-- es6num="4.2.1" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-objects">
      <h1>Objects</h1>
      <p>Even though ECMAScript includes syntax for class definitions, ECMAScript objects are not fundamentally class-based such as those in C++, Smalltalk, or Java. Instead objects may be created in various ways including via a literal notation or via <em>constructors</em> which create objects and then execute code that initializes all or part of them by assigning initial values to their properties. Each constructor is a function that has a property named `"prototype"` that is used to implement <em>prototype-based inheritance</em> and <em>shared properties</em>. Objects are created by using constructors in <b>new</b> expressions; for example, `new Date(2009,11)` creates a new Date object. Invoking a constructor without using <b>new</b> has consequences that depend on the constructor. For example, `Date()` produces a string representation of the current date and time rather than an object.</p>
      <p>Every object created by a constructor has an implicit reference (called the object's <em>prototype</em>) to the value of its constructor's `"prototype"` property. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the <em>prototype chain</em>. When a reference is made to a property in an object, that reference is to the property of that name in the first object in the prototype chain that contains a property of that name. In other words, first the object mentioned directly is examined for such a property; if that object contains the named property, that is the property to which the reference refers; if that object does not contain the named property, the prototype for that object is examined next; and so on.</p>
      <emu-figure id="figure-1" caption="Object/Prototype Relationships">
        <object data="img/figure-1.svg" height="354" type="image/svg+xml" width="719"> <img alt="An image of lots of boxes and arrows." height="354" src="img/figure-1.png" width="719"> </object>
      </emu-figure>
      <p>In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, while structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.</p>
      <p>All objects that do not directly contain a particular property that their prototype contains share that property and its value. Figure 1 illustrates this:</p>
      <p><b>CF</b> is a constructor (and also an object). Five objects have been created by using `new` expressions: <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. Each of these objects contains properties named `q1` and `q2`. The dashed lines represent the implicit prototype relationship; so, for example, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>'s prototype is <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>. The constructor, <b>CF</b>, has two properties itself, named `P1` and `P2`, which are not visible to <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, or <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b>. The property named `CFP1` in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b> is shared by <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> (but not by <b>CF</b>), as are any properties found in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>'s implicit prototype chain that are not named `q1`, `q2`, or `CFP1`. Notice that there is no implicit prototype link between <b>CF</b> and <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most class-based object languages, properties can be added to objects dynamically by assigning values to them. That is, constructors are not required to name or assign values to all or any of the constructed object's properties. In the above diagram, one could add a new shared property for <b>cf<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>3</sub></b>, <b>cf<sub>4</sub></b>, and <b>cf<sub>5</sub></b> by assigning a new value to the property in <b>CF<sub>p</sub></b>.</p>
      <p>Although ECMAScript objects are not inherently class-based, it is often convenient to define class-like abstractions based upon a common pattern of constructor functions, prototype objects, and methods. The ECMAScript built-in objects themselves follow such a class-like pattern. Beginning with ECMAScript 2015, the ECMAScript language includes syntactic class definitions that permit programmers to concisely define objects that conform to the same class-like abstraction pattern used by the built-in objects.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <!-- es6num="4.2.2" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-strict-variant-of-ecmascript">
      <h1>The Strict Variant of ECMAScript</h1>
      <p>The ECMAScript Language recognizes the possibility that some users of the language may wish to restrict their usage of some features available in the language. They might do so in the interests of security, to avoid what they consider to be error-prone features, to get enhanced error checking, or for other reasons of their choosing. In support of this possibility, ECMAScript defines a strict variant of the language. The strict variant of the language excludes some specific syntactic and semantic features of the regular ECMAScript language and modifies the detailed semantics of some features. The strict variant also specifies additional error conditions that must be reported by throwing error exceptions in situations that are not specified as errors by the non-strict form of the language.</p>
      <p>The strict variant of ECMAScript is commonly referred to as the <em>strict mode</em> of the language. Strict mode selection and use of the strict mode syntax and semantics of ECMAScript is explicitly made at the level of individual ECMAScript source text units. Because strict mode is selected at the level of a syntactic source text unit, strict mode only imposes restrictions that have local effect within such a source text unit. Strict mode does not restrict or modify any aspect of the ECMAScript semantics that must operate consistently across multiple source text units. A complete ECMAScript program may be composed of both strict mode and non-strict mode ECMAScript source text units. In this case, strict mode only applies when actually executing code that is defined within a strict mode source text unit.</p>
      <p>In order to conform to this specification, an ECMAScript implementation must implement both the full unrestricted ECMAScript language and the strict variant of the ECMAScript language as defined by this specification. In addition, an implementation must support the combination of unrestricted and strict mode source text units into a single composite program.</p>

      <h1>Context-Free Grammars</h1>
      <p>A <em>context-free grammar</em> consists of a number of <em>productions</em>. Each production has an abstract symbol called a <em>nonterminal</em> as its <em>left-hand side</em>, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and <em>terminal</em> symbols as its <em>right-hand side</em>. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>chain production</dfn> is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.</p>
      <p>Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called the <em>goal symbol</em>, a given context-free grammar specifies a <em>language</em>, namely, the (perhaps infinite) set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.</p>

    <!-- es6num="5.1.2" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars">
      <h1>The Lexical and RegExp Grammars</h1>
      <p>A <em>lexical grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar"></emu-xref>. This grammar has as its terminal symbols Unicode code points that conform to the rules for |SourceCharacter| defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-source-text"></emu-xref>. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol |InputElementDiv|, |InputElementTemplateTail|, or |InputElementRegExp|, or |InputElementRegExpOrTemplateTail|, that describe how sequences of such code points are translated into a sequence of input elements.</p>
      <p>Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript <em>tokens</em>. These tokens are the reserved words, identifiers, literals, and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line terminators, although not considered to be tokens, also become part of the stream of input elements and guide the process of automatic semicolon insertion (<emu-xref href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>). Simple white space and single-line comments are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar. A |MultiLineComment| (that is, a comment of the form `/*`&hellip;`*/` regardless of whether it spans more than one line) is likewise simply discarded if it contains no line terminator; but if a |MultiLineComment| contains one or more line terminators, then it is replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar.</p>
      <p>A <em>RegExp grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in <emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>. This grammar also has as its terminal symbols the code points as defined by |SourceCharacter|. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol |Pattern|, that describe how sequences of code points are translated into regular expression patterns.</p>
      <p>Productions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by having two colons &ldquo;<b>::</b>&rdquo; as separating punctuation. The lexical and RegExp grammars share some productions.</p>

      <p>Another grammar is used for translating Strings into numeric values. This grammar is similar to the part of the lexical grammar having to do with numeric literals and has as its terminal symbols |SourceCharacter|. This grammar appears in <emu-xref href="#sec-tonumber-applied-to-the-string-type"></emu-xref>.</p>
      <p>Productions of the numeric string grammar are distinguished by having three colons &ldquo;<b>:::</b>&rdquo; as punctuation.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <!-- es6num="5.1.4" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-syntactic-grammar">
      <h1>The Syntactic Grammar</h1>
      <p>The <em>syntactic grammar</em> for ECMAScript is given in clauses 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This grammar has ECMAScript tokens defined by the lexical grammar as its terminal symbols (<emu-xref href="#sec-lexical-and-regexp-grammars"></emu-xref>). It defines a set of productions, starting from two alternative goal symbols |Script| and |Module|, that describe how sequences of tokens form syntactically correct independent components of ECMAScript programs.</p>
      <p>When a stream of code points is to be parsed as an ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|, it is first converted to a stream of input elements by repeated application of the lexical grammar; this stream of input elements is then parsed by a single application of the syntactic grammar. The input stream is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements cannot be parsed as a single instance of the goal nonterminal (|Script| or |Module|), with no tokens left over.</p>
      <p>Productions of the syntactic grammar are distinguished by having just one colon &ldquo;<b>:</b>&rdquo; as punctuation.</p>
      <p>The syntactic grammar as presented in clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15 is not a complete account of which token sequences are accepted as a correct ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|. Certain additional token sequences are also accepted, namely, those that would be described by the grammar if only semicolons were added to the sequence in certain places (such as before line terminator characters). Furthermore, certain token sequences that are described by the grammar are not considered acceptable if a line terminator character appears in certain &ldquo;awkward&rdquo; places.</p>
      <p>In certain cases in order to avoid ambiguities the syntactic grammar uses generalized productions that permit token sequences that do not form a valid ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|. For example, this technique is used for object literals and object destructuring patterns. In such cases a more restrictive <em>supplemental grammar</em> is provided that further restricts the acceptable token sequences. In certain contexts, when explicitly specified, the input elements corresponding to such a production are parsed again using a goal symbol of a supplemental grammar. The input stream is syntactically in error if the tokens in the stream of input elements parsed by a cover grammar cannot be parsed as a single instance of the corresponding supplemental goal symbol, with no tokens left over.</p>
    </emu-clause>

    <!-- es6num="5.1.5" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-grammar-notation" namespace=grammar-notation>
      <h1>Grammar Notation</h1>
      <p>Terminal symbols of the lexical, RegExp, and numeric string grammars are shown in `fixed width` font, both in the productions of the grammars and throughout this specification whenever the text directly refers to such a terminal symbol. These are to appear in a script exactly as written. All terminal symbol code points specified in this way are to be understood as the appropriate Unicode code points from the Basic Latin range, as opposed to any similar-looking code points from other Unicode ranges.</p>
      <p>Nonterminal symbols are shown in _italic_ type. The definition of a nonterminal (also called a &ldquo;production&rdquo;) is introduced by the name of the nonterminal being defined followed by one or more colons. (The number of colons indicates to which grammar the production belongs.) One or more alternative right-hand sides for the nonterminal then follow on succeeding lines. For example, the syntactic definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        WhileStatement :
          `while` `(` Expression `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>states that the nonterminal |WhileStatement| represents the token `while`, followed by a left parenthesis token, followed by an |Expression|, followed by a right parenthesis token, followed by a |Statement|. The occurrences of |Expression| and |Statement| are themselves nonterminals. As another example, the syntactic definition:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        ArgumentList :
          AssignmentExpression
          ArgumentList `,` AssignmentExpression
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>states that an |ArgumentList| may represent either a single |AssignmentExpression| or an |ArgumentList|, followed by a comma, followed by an |AssignmentExpression|. This definition of |ArgumentList| is recursive, that is, it is defined in terms of itself. The result is that an |ArgumentList| may contain any positive number of arguments, separated by commas, where each argument expression is an |AssignmentExpression|. Such recursive definitions of nonterminals are common.</p>
      <p>The subscripted suffix &ldquo;<sub>opt</sub>&rdquo;, which may appear after a terminal or nonterminal, indicates an optional symbol. The alternative containing the optional symbol actually specifies two right-hand sides, one that omits the optional element and one that includes it. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer?
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier
          BindingIdentifier Initializer
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        IterationStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression? `;` Expression? `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        IterationStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` Expression? `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` Expression? `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>which in turn is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        IterationStatement :
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration `;` Expression `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` `)` Statement
          `for` `(` LexicalDeclaration Expression `;` Expression `)` Statement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>so, in this example, the nonterminal |IterationStatement| actually has four alternative right-hand sides.</p>
      <p>A production may be parameterized by a subscripted annotation of the form &ldquo;<sub>[parameters]</sub>&rdquo;, which may appear as a suffix to the nonterminal symbol defined by the production. &ldquo;<sub>parameters</sub>&rdquo; may be either a single name or a comma separated list of names. A parameterized production is shorthand for a set of productions defining all combinations of the parameter names, preceded by an underscore, appended to the parameterized nonterminal symbol. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList[Return] :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList[Return, In] :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList :

          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :

        StatementList_Return_In :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>Multiple parameters produce a combinatory number of productions, not all of which are necessarily referenced in a complete grammar.</p>
      <p>References to nonterminals on the right-hand side of a production can also be parameterized. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement[In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is equivalent to saying:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>A nonterminal reference may have both a parameter list and an &ldquo;<sub>opt</sub>&rdquo; suffix. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer[In]?
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier
          BindingIdentifier Initializer_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>Prefixing a parameter name with &ldquo;<sub>?</sub>&rdquo; on a right-hand side nonterminal reference makes that parameter value dependent upon the occurrence of the parameter name on the reference to the current production's left-hand side symbol. For example:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        VariableDeclaration[In] :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer[?In]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        VariableDeclaration :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer

        VariableDeclaration_In :
          BindingIdentifier Initializer_In
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>If a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with &ldquo;[+parameter]&rdquo; that alternative is only available if the named parameter was used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol. If a right-hand side alternative is prefixed with &ldquo;[\~parameter]&rdquo; that alternative is only available if the named parameter was <em>not</em> used in referencing the production's nonterminal symbol. This means that:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList[Return] :
          [+Return] ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList :
          ExpressionStatement

        StatementList_Return :
          ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>and that</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        StatementList[Return] :
          [~Return] ReturnStatement
          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>is an abbreviation for:</p>

          ExpressionStatement
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>When the words &ldquo;<b>one of</b>&rdquo; follow the colon(s) in a grammar definition, they signify that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or lines is an alternative definition. For example, the lexical grammar for ECMAScript contains the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        NonZeroDigit :: one of
          `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>which is merely a convenient abbreviation for:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        NonZeroDigit ::
          `1`
          `2`
          `3`
          `4`
          `5`
          `6`
          `7`
          `8`
          `9`
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[empty]&rdquo; appears as the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production's right-hand side contains no terminals or nonterminals.</p>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead &notin; _set_]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production, it indicates that the production may not be used if the immediately following input token sequence is a member of the given _set_. The _set_ can be written as a comma separated list of one or two element terminal sequences enclosed in curly brackets. For convenience, the set can also be written as a nonterminal, in which case it represents the set of all terminals to which that nonterminal could expand. If the _set_ consists of a single terminal the phrase &ldquo;[lookahead &ne; _terminal_]&rdquo; may be used.</p>
      <p>For example, given the definitions</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        DecimalDigit :: one of
          `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9`

        DecimalDigits ::
          DecimalDigit
          DecimalDigits DecimalDigit
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>the definition</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        LookaheadExample ::
          `n` [lookahead &lt;! {`1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `9`}] DecimalDigits
          DecimalDigit [lookahead &lt;! DecimalDigit]
      </emu-grammar>
      <p>matches either the letter `n` followed by one or more decimal digits the first of which is even, or a decimal digit not followed by another decimal digit.</p>
      <p>If the phrase &ldquo;[no |LineTerminator| here]&rdquo; appears in the right-hand side of a production of the syntactic grammar, it indicates that the production is <em>a restricted production</em>: it may not be used if a |LineTerminator| occurs in the input stream at the indicated position. For example, the production:</p>
      <emu-grammar>
        ThrowStatement :
          `throw` [no LineTerminator here] Expression `;`

      <p>indicates that the production may not be used if a |LineTerminator| occurs in the script between the `throw` token and the |Expression|.</p>
      <p>Unless the presence of a |LineTerminator| is forbidden by a restricted production, any number of occurrences of |LineTerminator| may appear between any two consecutive tokens in the stream of input elements without affecting the syntactic acceptability of the script.</p>

          IdentifierName but not ReservedWord
      </emu-grammar>

    <h1>Algorithm Conventions</h1>
    <p>The specification often uses a numbered list to specify steps in an algorithm. These algorithms are used to precisely specify the required semantics of ECMAScript language constructs. The algorithms are not intended to imply the use of any specific implementation technique. In practice, there may be more efficient algorithms available to implement a given feature.</p>
    <p>Algorithms may be explicitly parameterized, in which case the names and usage of the parameters must be provided as part of the algorithm's definition. In order to facilitate their use in multiple parts of this specification, some algorithms, called <em>abstract operations</em>, are named and written in parameterized functional form so that they may be referenced by name from within other algorithms. Abstract operations are typically referenced using a functional application style such as operationName(_arg1_, _arg2_). Some abstract operations are treated as polymorphically dispatched methods of class-like specification abstractions. Such method-like abstract operations are typically referenced using a method application style such as _someValue_.operationName(_arg1_, _arg2_).</p>
    <p>Calls to abstract operations return Completion Records. Abstract operations referenced using the functional application style and the method application style that are prefixed by `?` indicate that ReturnIfAbrupt should be applied to the resulting Completion Record. For example, ? operationName() is equivalent to ReturnIfAbrupt(operationName()). Similarly, ? _someValue_.operationName() is equivalent to ReturnIfAbrupt(_someValue_.operationName()).</p>
    <p>The prefix `!` is used to indicate that an abstract operation will never return an abrupt completion and that the resulting Completion Record's value field should be used in place of the return value of the operation. For example, &ldquo;Let _val_ be ! operationName()&rdquo; is equivalent to the following algorithm steps:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Let _val_ be operationName().
      1. Assert: _val_ is never an abrupt completion.
      1. If _val_ is a Completion Record, let _val_ be _val_.[[Value]].
    </emu-alg>
    <p>Algorithms may be associated with productions of one of the ECMAScript grammars. A production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have a distinct algorithm for each alternative. When an algorithm is associated with a grammar production, it may reference the terminal and nonterminal symbols of the production alternative as if they were parameters of the algorithm. When used in this manner, nonterminal symbols refer to the actual alternative definition that is matched when parsing the source text.</p>
    <p>When an algorithm is associated with a production alternative, the alternative is typically shown without any &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo; grammar annotations. Such annotations should only affect the syntactic recognition of the alternative and have no effect on the associated semantics for the alternative.</p>
    <p>Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all chain productions have an implicit definition for every algorithm that might be applied to that production's left-hand side nonterminal. The implicit definition simply reapplies the same algorithm name with the same parameters, if any, to the chain production's sole right-hand side nonterminal and then returns the result. For example, assume there is a production:</p>
    <emu-grammar>
      Block :
        `{` StatementList `}`
    </emu-grammar>
    <p>but there is no corresponding Evaluation algorithm that is explicitly specified for that production. If in some algorithm there is a statement of the form: &ldquo;Return the result of evaluating |Block|&rdquo; it is implicit that an Evaluation algorithm exists of the form:</p>
    <p><b>Runtime Semantics: Evaluation</b></p>
    <emu-grammar>Block : `{` StatementList `}`</emu-grammar>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Return the result of evaluating |StatementList|.
    </emu-alg>
    <p>For clarity of expression, algorithm steps may be subdivided into sequential substeps. Substeps are indented and may themselves be further divided into indented substeps. Outline numbering conventions are used to identify substeps with the first level of substeps labelled with lower case alphabetic characters and the second level of substeps labelled with lower case roman numerals. If more than three levels are required these rules repeat with the fourth level using numeric labels. For example:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. Top-level step
        1. Substep.
        1. Substep.
          1. Subsubstep.
            1. Subsubsubstep
              1. Subsubsubsubstep
                1. Subsubsubsubsubstep
    </emu-alg>
    <p>A step or substep may be written as an &ldquo;if&rdquo; predicate that conditions its substeps. In this case, the substeps are only applied if the predicate is true. If a step or substep begins with the word &ldquo;else&rdquo;, it is a predicate that is the negation of the preceding &ldquo;if&rdquo; predicate step at the same level.</p>
    <p>A step may specify the iterative application of its substeps.</p>
    <p>A step that begins with &ldquo;Assert:&rdquo; asserts an invariant condition of its algorithm. Such assertions are used to make explicit algorithmic invariants that would otherwise be implicit. Such assertions add no additional semantic requirements and hence need not be checked by an implementation. They are used simply to clarify algorithms.</p>
    <p>Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, negation, multiplication, division, and the mathematical functions defined later in this clause should always be understood as computing exact mathematical results on mathematical real numbers, which unless otherwise noted do not include infinities and do not include a negative zero that is distinguished from positive zero. Algorithms in this standard that model floating-point arithmetic include explicit steps, where necessary, to handle infinities and signed zero and to perform rounding. If a mathematical operation or function is applied to a floating-point number, it should be understood as being applied to the exact mathematical value represented by that floating-point number; such a floating-point number must be finite, and if it is *+0* or *-0* then the corresponding mathematical value is simply 0.</p>
    <p>The mathematical function <emu-eqn aoid="abs">abs(_x_)</emu-eqn> produces the absolute value of _x_, which is <emu-eqn>-_x_</emu-eqn> if _x_ is negative (less than zero) and otherwise is _x_ itself.</p>
    <p>The mathematical function <emu-eqn aoid="min">min(_x1_, _x2_, ..., _xN_)</emu-eqn> produces the mathematically smallest of <emu-eqn>_x1_</emu-eqn> through <emu-eqn>_xN_</emu-eqn>. The mathematical function <emu-eqn aoid="max">max(_x1_, _x2_, ..., _xN_)</emu-eqn> produces the mathematically largest of <emu-eqn>_x1_</emu-eqn> through <emu-eqn>_xN_</emu-eqn>. The domain and range of these mathematical functions include *+&infin;* and *-&infin;*.</p>
    <p>The notation &ldquo;<emu-eqn aoid="modulo">_x_ modulo _y_</emu-eqn>&rdquo; (_y_ must be finite and nonzero) computes a value _k_ of the same sign as _y_ (or zero) such that <emu-eqn>abs(_k_) &lt; abs(_y_) and _x_-_k_ = _q_ &times; _y_</emu-eqn> for some integer _q_.</p>
    <p>The mathematical function <emu-eqn aoid="floor">floor(_x_)</emu-eqn> produces the largest integer (closest to positive infinity) that is not larger than _x_.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p><emu-eqn>floor(_x_) = _x_-(_x_ modulo 1)</emu-eqn>.</p>

    <h1>Static Semantic Rules</h1>
    <p>Context-free grammars are not sufficiently powerful to express all the rules that define whether a stream of input elements form a valid ECMAScript |Script| or |Module| that may be evaluated. In some situations additional rules are needed that may be expressed using either ECMAScript algorithm conventions or prose requirements. Such rules are always associated with a production of a grammar and are called the <em>static semantics</em> of the production.</p>
    <p>Static Semantic Rules have names and typically are defined using an algorithm. Named Static Semantic Rules are associated with grammar productions and a production that has multiple alternative definitions will typically have for each alternative a distinct algorithm for each applicable named static semantic rule.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified every grammar production alternative in this specification implicitly has a definition for a static semantic rule named Contains which takes an argument named _symbol_ whose value is a terminal or nonterminal of the grammar that includes the associated production. The default definition of Contains is:</p>
    <emu-alg>
      1. For each terminal and nonterminal grammar symbol, _sym_, in the definition of this production do
        1. If _sym_ is the same grammar symbol as _symbol_, return *true*.
        1. If _sym_ is a nonterminal, then
          1. Let _contained_ be the result of _sym_ Contains _symbol_.
          1. If _contained_ is *true*, return *true*.
      1. Return *false*.
    </emu-alg>
    <p>The above definition is explicitly over-ridden for specific productions.</p>
    <p>A special kind of static semantic rule is an <dfn id="early-error-rule">Early Error Rule</dfn>. Early error rules define early error conditions (see clause <emu-xref href="#sec-error-handling-and-language-extensions"></emu-xref>) that are associated with specific grammar productions. Evaluation of most early error rules are not explicitly invoked within the algorithms of this specification. A conforming implementation must, prior to the first evaluation of a |Script| or |Module|, validate all of the early error rules of the productions used to parse that |Script| or |Module|. If any of the early error rules are violated the |Script| or |Module| is invalid and cannot be evaluated.</p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type">
      <h1>The String Type</h1>
      <p>The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values (&ldquo;elements&rdquo;) up to a maximum length of 2<sup>53</sup>-1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value. Each element is regarded as occupying a position within the sequence. These positions are indexed with nonnegative integers. The first element (if any) is at index 0, the next element (if any) at index 1, and so on. The length of a String is the number of elements (i.e., 16-bit values) within it. The empty String has length zero and therefore contains no elements.</p>
      <p>Where ECMAScript operations interpret String values, each element is interpreted as a single UTF-16 code unit. However, ECMAScript does not place any restrictions or requirements on the sequence of code units in a String value, so they may be ill-formed when interpreted as UTF-16 code unit sequences. Operations that do not interpret String contents treat them as sequences of undifferentiated 16-bit unsigned integers. The function `String.prototype.normalize` (see <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.normalize"></emu-xref>) can be used to explicitly normalize a String value. `String.prototype.localeCompare` (see <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.localecompare"></emu-xref>) internally normalizes String values, but no other operations implicitly normalize the strings upon which they operate. Only operations that are explicitly specified to be language or locale sensitive produce language-sensitive results.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The rationale behind this design was to keep the implementation of Strings as simple and high-performing as possible. If ECMAScript source text is in Normalized Form C, string literals are guaranteed to also be normalized, as long as they do not contain any Unicode escape sequences.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <p>Some operations interpret String contents as UTF-16 encoded Unicode code points. In that case the interpretation is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A code unit in the range 0 to 0xD7FF or in the range 0xE000 to 0xFFFF is interpreted as a code point with the same value.
        </li>
        <li>
          A sequence of two code units, where the first code unit _c1_ is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF and the second code unit _c2_ is in the range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF, is a surrogate pair and is interpreted as a code point with the value (_c1_ - 0xD800) &times; 0x400 + (_c2_ - 0xDC00) + 0x10000. (See <emu-xref href="#sec-utf16decode"></emu-xref>)
        </li>
        <li>
          A code unit that is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF, but is not part of a surrogate pair, is interpreted as a code point with the same value.

      <p>There are two other special values, called *positive Infinity* and *negative Infinity*. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols *+&infin;* and *-&infin;*, respectively. (Note that these two infinite Number values are produced by the program expressions `+Infinity` (or simply `Infinity`) and `-Infinity`.)</p>
      <p>The other 18437736874454810624 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup>-2<sup>53</sup></emu-eqn>) values are called the finite numbers. Half of these are positive numbers and half are negative numbers; for every finite positive Number value there is a corresponding negative value having the same magnitude.</p>
      <p>Note that there is both a *positive zero* and a *negative zero*. For brevity, these values are also referred to for expository purposes by the symbols *+0* and *-0*, respectively. (Note that these two different zero Number values are produced by the program expressions `+0` (or simply `0`) and `-0`.)</p>
      <p>The 18437736874454810622 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup>-2<sup>53</sup>-2</emu-eqn>) finite nonzero values are of two kinds:</p>
      <p>18428729675200069632 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>64</sup>-2<sup>54</sup></emu-eqn>) of them are normalized, having the form</p>
      <div class="math-display">
        _s_ &times; _m_ &times; 2<sup>_e_</sup>
      </div>
      <p>where _s_ is +1 or -1, _m_ is a positive integer less than 2<sup>53</sup> but not less than 2<sup>52</sup>, and _e_ is an integer ranging from -1074 to 971, inclusive.</p>
      <p>The remaining 9007199254740990 (that is, <emu-eqn>2<sup>53</sup>-2</emu-eqn>) values are denormalized, having the form</p>
      <div class="math-display">
        _s_ &times; _m_ &times; 2<sup>_e_</sup>
      </div>
      <p>where _s_ is +1 or -1, _m_ is a positive integer less than 2<sup>52</sup>, and _e_ is -1074.</p>
      <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are representable in the Number type (indeed, the integer 0 has two representations, *+0* and *-0*).</p>
      <p>A finite number has an <em>odd significand</em> if it is nonzero and the integer _m_ used to express it (in one of the two forms shown above) is odd. Otherwise, it has an <em>even significand</em>.</p>
      <p>In this specification, the phrase &ldquo;the Number value for _x_&rdquo; where _x_ represents an exact nonzero real mathematical quantity (which might even be an irrational number such as &pi;) means a Number value chosen in the following manner. Consider the set of all finite values of the Number type, with *-0* removed and with two additional values added to it that are not representable in the Number type, namely 2<sup>1024</sup> (which is <emu-eqn>+1 &times; 2<sup>53</sup> &times; 2<sup>971</sup></emu-eqn>) and <emu-eqn>-2<sup>1024</sup></emu-eqn> (which is <emu-eqn>-1 &times; 2<sup>53</sup> &times; 2<sup>971</sup></emu-eqn>). Choose the member of this set that is closest in value to _x_. If two values of the set are equally close, then the one with an even significand is chosen; for this purpose, the two extra values 2<sup>1024</sup> and <emu-eqn>-2<sup>1024</sup></emu-eqn> are considered to have even significands. Finally, if 2<sup>1024</sup> was chosen, replace it with *+&infin;*; if <emu-eqn>-2<sup>1024</sup></emu-eqn> was chosen, replace it with *-&infin;*; if *+0* was chosen, replace it with *-0* if and only if _x_ is less than zero; any other chosen value is used unchanged. The result is the Number value for _x_. (This procedure corresponds exactly to the behaviour of the IEEE 754-2008 &ldquo;round to nearest, ties to even&rdquo; mode.)</p>
      <p>Some ECMAScript operators deal only with integers in specific ranges such as <emu-eqn>-2<sup>31</sup></emu-eqn> through <emu-eqn>2<sup>31</sup>-1</emu-eqn>, inclusive, or in the range 0 through <emu-eqn>2<sup>16</sup>-1</emu-eqn>, inclusive. These operators accept any value of the Number type but first convert each such value to an integer value in the expected range. See the descriptions of the numeric conversion operations in <emu-xref href="#sec-type-conversion"></emu-xref>.</p>

      <h1>The Object Type</h1>
      <p>An Object is logically a collection of properties. Each property is either a data property, or an accessor property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <em>data property</em> associates a key value with an ECMAScript language value and a set of Boolean attributes.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <em>accessor property</em> associates a key value with one or two accessor functions, and a set of Boolean attributes. The accessor functions are used to store or retrieve an ECMAScript language value that is associated with the property.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Properties are identified using key values. A property key value is either an ECMAScript String value or a Symbol value. All String and Symbol values, including the empty string, are valid as property keys. A <em>property name</em> is a property key that is a String value.</p>
      <p>An <em>integer index</em> is a String-valued property key that is a canonical numeric String (see <emu-xref href="#sec-canonicalnumericindexstring"></emu-xref>) and whose numeric value is either *+0* or a positive integer &le; 2<sup>53</sup>-1. An <em>array index</em> is an integer index whose numeric value _i_ is in the range <emu-eqn>+0 &le; _i_ &lt; 2<sup>32</sup>-1</emu-eqn>.</p>
      <p>Property keys are used to access properties and their values. There are two kinds of access for properties: <em>get</em> and <em>set</em>, corresponding to value retrieval and assignment, respectively. The properties accessible via get and set access includes both <em>own properties</em> that are a direct part of an object and <em>inherited properties</em> which are provided by another associated object via a property inheritance relationship. Inherited properties may be either own or inherited properties of the associated object. Each own property of an object must each have a key value that is distinct from the key values of the other own properties of that object.</p>
      <p>All objects are logically collections of properties, but there are multiple forms of objects that differ in their semantics for accessing and manipulating their properties. <em>Ordinary objects</em> are the most common form of objects and have the default object semantics. An <em>exotic object</em> is any form of object whose property semantics differ in any way from the default semantics.</p>

        <h1>Object Internal Methods and Internal Slots</h1>
        <p>The actual semantics of objects, in ECMAScript, are specified via algorithms called <em>internal methods</em>. Each object in an ECMAScript engine is associated with a set of internal methods that defines its runtime behaviour. These internal methods are not part of the ECMAScript language. They are defined by this specification purely for expository purposes. However, each object within an implementation of ECMAScript must behave as specified by the internal methods associated with it. The exact manner in which this is accomplished is determined by the implementation.</p>
        <p>Internal method names are polymorphic. This means that different object values may perform different algorithms when a common internal method name is invoked upon them. That actual object upon which an internal method is invoked is the &ldquo;target&rdquo; of the invocation. If, at runtime, the implementation of an algorithm attempts to use an internal method of an object that the object does not support, a *TypeError* exception is thrown.</p>
        <p>Internal slots correspond to internal state that is associated with objects and used by various ECMAScript specification algorithms. Internal slots are not object properties and they are not inherited. Depending upon the specific internal slot specification, such state may consist of values of any ECMAScript language type or of specific ECMAScript specification type values. Unless explicitly specified otherwise, internal slots are allocated as part of the process of creating an object and may not be dynamically added to an object. Unless specified otherwise, the initial value of an internal slot is the value *undefined*. Various algorithms within this specification create objects that have internal slots. However, the ECMAScript language provides no direct way to associate internal slots with an object.</p>
        <p>Internal methods and internal slots are identified within this specification using names enclosed in double square brackets [[ ]].</p>
        <p><emu-xref href="#table-5"></emu-xref> summarizes the <em>essential internal methods</em> used by this specification that are applicable to all objects created or manipulated by ECMAScript code. Every object must have algorithms for all of the essential internal methods. However, all objects do not necessarily use the same algorithms for those methods.</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;Signature&rdquo; column of <emu-xref href="#table-5"></emu-xref> and other similar tables describes the invocation pattern for each internal method. The invocation pattern always includes a parenthesized list of descriptive parameter names. If a parameter name is the same as an ECMAScript type name then the name describes the required type of the parameter value. If an internal method explicitly returns a value, its parameter list is followed by the symbol &ldquo;&rarr;&rdquo; and the type name of the returned value. The type names used in signatures refer to the types defined in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values"></emu-xref> augmented by the following additional names. &ldquo;<em>any</em>&rdquo; means the value may be any ECMAScript language type. An internal method implicitly returns a Completion Record. In addition to its parameters, an internal method always has access to the object that is the target of the method invocation.</p>

        <h1>Invariants of the Essential Internal Methods</h1>
        <p>The Internal Methods of Objects of an ECMAScript engine must conform to the list of invariants specified below. Ordinary ECMAScript Objects as well as all standard exotic objects in this specification maintain these invariants. ECMAScript Proxy objects maintain these invariants by means of runtime checks on the result of traps invoked on the [[ProxyHandler]] object.</p>
        <p>Any implementation provided exotic objects must also maintain these invariants for those objects. Violation of these invariants may cause ECMAScript code to have unpredictable behaviour and create security issues. However, violation of these invariants must never compromise the memory safety of an implementation.</p>
        <p>An implementation must not allow these invariants to be circumvented in any manner such as by providing alternative interfaces that implement the functionality of the essential internal methods without enforcing their invariants.</p>
        <h2>Definitions:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <em>target</em> of an internal method is the object upon which the internal method is called.
          </li>
          <li>
            A target is <em>non-extensible</em> if it has been observed to return false from its [[IsExtensible]] internal method, or true from its [[PreventExtensions]] internal method.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>non-existent</em> property is a property that does not exist as an own property on a non-extensible target.
          </li>
          <li>
            All references to <em>SameValue</em> are according to the definition of the SameValue algorithm.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>[[GetPrototypeOf]] ( )</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Type of the return value must be either Object or Null.
          </li>
          <li>
            If target is non-extensible, and [[GetPrototypeOf]] returns a value v, then any future calls to [[GetPrototypeOf]] should return the SameValue as v.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <emu-note>
          <p>An object's prototype chain should have finite length (that is, starting from any object, recursively applying the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal method to its result should eventually lead to the value null). However, this requirement is not enforceable as an object level invariant if the prototype chain includes any exotic objects that do not use the ordinary object definition of [[GetPrototypeOf]]. Such a circular prototype chain may result in infinite loops when accessing object properties.</p>

        <h2>[[SetPrototypeOf]] (_V_)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Type of the return value must be Boolean.
          </li>

            If target is non-extensible, [[SetPrototypeOf]] must return false, unless V is the SameValue as the target's observed [[GetPrototypeOf]] value.

        <h2>[[PreventExtensions]] ( )</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Type of the return value must be Boolean.
          </li>
          <li>
            If [[PreventExtensions]] returns true, all future calls to [[IsExtensible]] on the target must return false and the target is now considered non-extensible.

          </li>
          <li>
            If a property P is described as a data property with Desc.[[Value]] equal to v and Desc.[[Writable]] and Desc.[[Configurable]] are both false, then the SameValue must be returned for the Desc.[[Value]] attribute of the property on all future calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] ( P ).
          </li>
          <li>
            If P's attributes other than [[Writable]] may change over time or if the property might disappear, then P's [[Configurable]] attribute must be true.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the [[Writable]] attribute may change from false to true, then the [[Configurable]] attribute must be true.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the target is non-extensible and P is non-existent, then all future calls to [[GetOwnProperty]] (P) on the target must describe P as non-existent (i.e. [[GetOwnProperty]] (P) must return undefined).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <emu-note>
          <p>As a consequence of the third invariant, if a property is described as a data property and it may return different values over time, then either or both of the Desc.[[Writable]] and Desc.[[Configurable]] attributes must be true even if no mechanism to change the value is exposed via the other internal methods.</p>

    <h1>ECMAScript Specification Types</h1>
    <p>A specification type corresponds to meta-values that are used within algorithms to describe the semantics of ECMAScript language constructs and ECMAScript language types. The specification types are Reference, List, Completion, Property Descriptor, Lexical Environment, Environment Record, and Data Block. Specification type values are specification artefacts that do not necessarily correspond to any specific entity within an ECMAScript implementation. Specification type values may be used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression evaluation but such values cannot be stored as properties of objects or values of ECMAScript language variables.</p>

    <!-- es6num="6.2.1" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-list-and-record-specification-type">
      <h1>The List and Record Specification Types</h1>
      <p>The <dfn>List</dfn> type is used to explain the evaluation of argument lists (see <emu-xref href="#sec-argument-lists"></emu-xref>) in `new` expressions, in function calls, and in other algorithms where a simple ordered list of values is needed. Values of the List type are simply ordered sequences of list elements containing the individual values. These sequences may be of any length. The elements of a list may be randomly accessed using 0-origin indices. For notational convenience an array-like syntax can be used to access List elements. For example, _arguments_[2] is shorthand for saying the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of the List _arguments_.</p>
      <p>For notational convenience within this specification, a literal syntax can be used to express a new List value. For example, &laquo; 1, 2 &raquo; defines a List value that has two elements each of which is initialized to a specific value. A new empty List can be expressed as &laquo; &raquo;.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Record</dfn> type is used to describe data aggregations within the algorithms of this specification. A Record type value consists of one or more named fields. The value of each field is either an ECMAScript value or an abstract value represented by a name associated with the Record type. Field names are always enclosed in double brackets, for example [[Value]].</p>
      <p>For notational convenience within this specification, an object literal-like syntax can be used to express a Record value. For example, {[[Field1]]: 42, [[Field2]]: *false*, [[Field3]]: ~empty~} defines a Record value that has three fields, each of which is initialized to a specific value. Field name order is not significant. Any fields that are not explicitly listed are considered to be absent.</p>
      <p>In specification text and algorithms, dot notation may be used to refer to a specific field of a Record value. For example, if R is the record shown in the previous paragraph then R.[[Field2]] is shorthand for &ldquo;the field of R named [[Field2]]&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Schema for commonly used Record field combinations may be named, and that name may be used as a prefix to a literal Record value to identify the specific kind of aggregations that is being described. For example: PropertyDescriptor{[[Value]]: 42, [[Writable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true*}.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>Reference</dfn> is a resolved name or property binding. A Reference consists of three components, the <em>base</em> value, the <em>referenced name</em> and the Boolean valued <em>strict reference</em> flag. The <em>base</em> value is either *undefined*, an Object, a Boolean, a String, a Symbol, a Number, or an Environment Record. A _base_ value of *undefined* indicates that the Reference could not be resolved to a binding. The <em>referenced name</em> is a String or Symbol value.</p>
      <p>A Super Reference is a Reference that is used to represents a name binding that was expressed using the super keyword. A Super Reference has an additional _thisValue_ component and its _base_ value will never be an Environment Record.</p>

      <h1>The Property Descriptor Specification Type</h1>
      <p>The <dfn>Property Descriptor</dfn> type is used to explain the manipulation and reification of Object property attributes. Values of the Property Descriptor type are Records. Each field's name is an attribute name and its value is a corresponding attribute value as specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-property-attributes"></emu-xref>. In addition, any field may be present or absent. The schema name used within this specification to tag literal descriptions of Property Descriptor records is &ldquo;PropertyDescriptor&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Property Descriptor values may be further classified as data Property Descriptors and accessor Property Descriptors based upon the existence or use of certain fields. A data Property Descriptor is one that includes any fields named either [[Value]] or [[Writable]]. An accessor Property Descriptor is one that includes any fields named either [[Get]] or [[Set]]. Any Property Descriptor may have fields named [[Enumerable]] and [[Configurable]]. A Property Descriptor value may not be both a data Property Descriptor and an accessor Property Descriptor; however, it may be neither. A generic Property Descriptor is a Property Descriptor value that is neither a data Property Descriptor nor an accessor Property Descriptor. A fully populated Property Descriptor is one that is either an accessor Property Descriptor or a data Property Descriptor and that has all of the fields that correspond to the property attributes defined in either <emu-xref href="#table-2"></emu-xref> or <emu-xref href="#table-3"></emu-xref>.</p>

          <p>The conversion of a String to a Number value is similar overall to the determination of the Number value for a numeric literal (see <emu-xref href="#sec-literals-numeric-literals"></emu-xref>), but some of the details are different, so the process for converting a String numeric literal to a value of Number type is given here. This value is determined in two steps: first, a mathematical value (MV) is derived from the String numeric literal; second, this mathematical value is rounded as described below.

    <h1>Lexical Environments</h1>
    <p>A <dfn>Lexical Environment</dfn> is a specification type used to define the association of |Identifier|s to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an <em>outer</em> Lexical Environment. Usually a Lexical Environment is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a |FunctionDeclaration|, a |BlockStatement|, or a |Catch| clause of a |TryStatement| and a new Lexical Environment is created each time such code is evaluated.</p>
    <p>An Environment Record records the identifier bindings that are created within the scope of its associated Lexical Environment. It is referred to as the Lexical Environment's <dfn>EnvironmentRecord</dfn></p>
    <p>The outer environment reference is used to model the logical nesting of Lexical Environment values. The outer reference of a (inner) Lexical Environment is a reference to the Lexical Environment that logically surrounds the inner Lexical Environment. An outer Lexical Environment may, of course, have its own outer Lexical Environment. A Lexical Environment may serve as the outer environment for multiple inner Lexical Environments. For example, if a |FunctionDeclaration| contains two nested |FunctionDeclaration|s then the Lexical Environments of each of the nested functions will have as their outer Lexical Environment the Lexical Environment of the current evaluation of the surrounding function.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="global-environment">global environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment which does not have an outer environment. The global environment's outer environment reference is *null*. A global environment's EnvironmentRecord may be prepopulated with identifier bindings and includes an associated <dfn id="global-object">global object</dfn> whose properties provide some of the global environment's identifier bindings. As ECMAScript code is executed, additional properties may be added to the global object and the initial properties may be modified.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="module-environment">module environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment that contains the bindings for the top level declarations of a |Module|. It also contains the bindings that are explicitly imported by the |Module|. The outer environment of a module environment is a global environment.</p>
    <p>A <dfn id="function-environment">function environment</dfn> is a Lexical Environment that corresponds to the invocation of an ECMAScript function object. A function environment may establish a new `this` binding. A function environment also captures the state necessary to support `super` method invocations.</p>
    <p>Lexical Environments and Environment Record values are purely specification mechanisms and need not correspond to any specific artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. It is impossible for an ECMAScript program to directly access or manipulate such values.</p>

    <!-- es6num="8.1.1" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-environment-records">
      <h1>Environment Records</h1>
      <p>There are two primary kinds of <dfn>Environment Record</dfn> values used in this specification: <em>declarative Environment Records</em> and <em>object Environment Records</em>. Declarative Environment Records are used to define the effect of ECMAScript language syntactic elements such as |FunctionDeclaration|s, |VariableDeclaration|s, and |Catch| clauses that directly associate identifier bindings with ECMAScript language values. Object Environment Records are used to define the effect of ECMAScript elements such as |WithStatement| that associate identifier bindings with the properties of some object. Global Environment Records and function Environment Records are specializations that are used for specifically for |Script| global declarations and for top-level declarations within functions.</p>
      <p>For specification purposes Environment Record values are values of the Record specification type and can be thought of as existing in a simple object-oriented hierarchy where Environment Record is an abstract class with three concrete subclasses, declarative Environment Record, object Environment Record, and global Environment Record. Function Environment Records and module Environment Records are subclasses of declarative Environment Record. The abstract class includes the abstract specification methods defined in <emu-xref href="#table-15"></emu-xref>. These abstract methods have distinct concrete algorithms for each of the concrete subclasses.</p>

        <h1>Global Environment Records</h1>
        <p>A global Environment Record is used to represent the outer most scope that is shared by all of the ECMAScript |Script| elements that are processed in a common realm. A global Environment Record provides the bindings for built-in globals (clause <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref>), properties of the global object, and for all top-level declarations (<emu-xref href="#sec-block-static-semantics-toplevellexicallyscopeddeclarations"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-block-static-semantics-toplevelvarscopeddeclarations"></emu-xref>) that occur within a |Script|.</p>
        <p>A global Environment Record is logically a single record but it is specified as a composite encapsulating an object Environment Record and a declarative Environment Record. The object Environment Record has as its base object the global object of the associated Realm Record. This global object is the value returned by the global Environment Record's GetThisBinding concrete method. The object Environment Record component of a global Environment Record contains the bindings for all built-in globals (clause <emu-xref href="#sec-global-object"></emu-xref>) and all bindings introduced by a |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, or |VariableStatement| contained in global code. The bindings for all other ECMAScript declarations in global code are contained in the declarative Environment Record component of the global Environment Record.</p>
        <p>Properties may be created directly on a global object. Hence, the object Environment Record component of a global Environment Record may contain both bindings created explicitly by |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, or |VariableDeclaration| declarations and bindings created implicitly as properties of the global object. In order to identify which bindings were explicitly created using declarations, a global Environment Record maintains a list of the names bound using its CreateGlobalVarBinding and CreateGlobalFunctionBinding concrete methods.</p>
        <p>Global Environment Records have the additional fields listed in <emu-xref href="#table-18"></emu-xref> and the additional methods listed in <emu-xref href="#table-19"></emu-xref>.</p>

    <p>Evaluation of code by the running execution context may be suspended at various points defined within this specification. Once the running execution context has been suspended a different execution context may become the running execution context and commence evaluating its code. At some later time a suspended execution context may again become the running execution context and continue evaluating its code at the point where it had previously been suspended. Transition of the running execution context status among execution contexts usually occurs in stack-like last-in/first-out manner. However, some ECMAScript features require non-LIFO transitions of the running execution context.</p>

    <p>A request for the future execution of a Job is made by enqueueing, on a Job Queue, a PendingJob record that includes a Job abstract operation name and any necessary argument values. When there is no running execution context and the execution context stack is empty, the ECMAScript implementation removes the first PendingJob from a Job Queue and uses the information contained in it to create an execution context and starts execution of the associated Job abstract operation.</p>
    <p>The PendingJob records from a single Job Queue are always initiated in FIFO order. This specification does not define the order in which multiple Job Queues are serviced. An ECMAScript implementation may interweave the FIFO evaluation of the PendingJob records of a Job Queue with the evaluation of the PendingJob records of one or more other Job Queues. An implementation must define what occurs when there are no running execution context and all Job Queues are empty.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>Typically an ECMAScript implementation will have its Job Queues pre-initialized with at least one PendingJob and one of those Jobs will be the first to be executed. An implementation might choose to free all resources and terminate if the current Job completes and all Job Queues are empty. Alternatively, it might choose to wait for a some implementation specific agent or mechanism to enqueue new PendingJob requests.</p>

In either case, the effect of calling such functions must conform to their specifications. An implementation may also provide additional built-in function objects that are not defined in this specification.</p>
    <p>If a built-in function object is implemented as an exotic object it must have the ordinary object behaviour specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref>. All such exotic function objects also have [[Prototype]], [[Extensible]], [[Realm]], and [[ScriptOrModule]] internal slots.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function object has the %FunctionPrototype% object as the initial value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot.</p>
    <p>The behaviour specified for each built-in function via algorithm steps or other means is the specification of the function body behaviour for both [[Call]] and [[Construct]] invocations of the function. However, [[Construct]] invocation is not supported by all built-in functions. For each built-in function, when invoked with [[Call]], the [[Call]] _thisArgument_ provides the *this* value, the [[Call]] _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the NewTarget value is *undefined*. When invoked with [[Construct]], the *this* value is uninitialized, the [[Construct]] _argumentsList_ provides the named parameters, and the [[Construct]] _newTarget_ parameter provides the NewTarget value. If the built-in function is implemented as an ECMAScript function object then this specified behaviour must be implemented by the ECMAScript code that is the body of the function. Built-in functions that are ECMAScript function objects must be strict mode functions. If a built-in constructor has any [[Call]] behaviour other than throwing a *TypeError* exception, an ECMAScript implementation of the function must be done in a manner that does not cause the function's [[FunctionKind]] internal slot to have the value `"classConstructor"`.</p>
    <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function. When a built-in constructor is called as part of a `new` expression the _argumentsList_ parameter of the invoked [[Construct]] internal method provides the values for the built-in constructor's named parameters.</p>

      <h1>Array Exotic Objects</h1>
      <p>An <em>Array object</em> is an exotic object that gives special treatment to array index property keys (see <emu-xref href="#sec-object-type"></emu-xref>). A property whose property name is an array index is also called an <em>element</em>. Every Array object has a `length` property whose value is always a nonnegative integer less than 2<sup>32</sup>. The value of the `length` property is numerically greater than the name of every own property whose name is an array index; whenever an own property of an Array object is created or changed, other properties are adjusted as necessary to maintain this invariant. Specifically, whenever an own property is added whose name is an array index, the value of the `length` property is changed, if necessary, to be one more than the numeric value of that array index; and whenever the value of the `length` property is changed, every own property whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new length is deleted. This constraint applies only to own properties of an Array object and is unaffected by `length` or array index properties that may be inherited from its prototypes.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>A String property name _P_ is an <em>array index</em> if and only if ToString(ToUint32(_P_)) is equal to _P_ and ToUint32(_P_) is not equal to <emu-eqn>2<sup>32</sup>-1</emu-eqn>.</p>

      <h1>Arguments Exotic Objects</h1>
      <p>Most ECMAScript functions make an arguments object available to their code. Depending upon the characteristics of the function definition, its arguments object is either an ordinary object or an <em>arguments exotic object</em>. An arguments exotic object is an exotic object whose array index properties map to the formal parameters bindings of an invocation of its associated ECMAScript function.</p>
      <p>Arguments exotic objects have the same internal slots as ordinary objects. They also have a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot. Ordinary arguments objects also have a [[ParameterMap]] internal slot whose value is always undefined. For ordinary argument objects the [[ParameterMap]] internal slot is only used by `Object.prototype.toString` (<emu-xref href="#sec-object.prototype.tostring"></emu-xref>) to identify them as such.</p>
      <p>Arguments exotic objects provide alternative definitions for the following internal methods. All of the other exotic arguments object essential internal methods that are not defined below are as specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots"></emu-xref></p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>For non-strict functions the integer indexed data properties of an arguments object whose numeric name values are less than the number of formal parameters of the corresponding function object initially share their values with the corresponding argument bindings in the function's execution context. This means that changing the property changes the corresponding value of the argument binding and vice-versa. This correspondence is broken if such a property is deleted and then redefined or if the property is changed into an accessor property. For strict mode functions, the values of the arguments object's properties are simply a copy of the arguments passed to the function and there is no dynamic linkage between the property values and the formal parameter values.</p>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The ParameterMap object and its property values are used as a device for specifying the arguments object correspondence to argument bindings. The ParameterMap object and the objects that are the values of its properties are not directly observable from ECMAScript code. An ECMAScript implementation does not need to actually create or use such objects to implement the specified semantics.</p>

        <p>Arguments objects for strict mode functions define non-configurable accessor properties named `"caller"` and `"callee"` which throw a *TypeError* exception on access. The `"callee"` property has a more specific meaning for non-strict functions and a `"caller"` property has historically been provided as an implementation-defined extension by some ECMAScript implementations. The strict mode definition of these properties exists to ensure that neither of them is defined in any other manner by conforming ECMAScript implementations.</p>

    <p>When a handler method is called to provide the implementation of a proxy object internal method, the handler method is passed the proxy's target object as a parameter. A proxy's handler object does not necessarily have a method corresponding to every essential internal method. Invoking an internal method on the proxy results in the invocation of the corresponding internal method on the proxy's target object if the handler object does not have a method corresponding to the internal trap.</p>
    <p>The [[ProxyHandler]] and [[ProxyTarget]] internal slots of a proxy object are always initialized when the object is created and typically may not be modified. Some proxy objects are created in a manner that permits them to be subsequently <em>revoked</em>. When a proxy is revoked, its [[ProxyHandler]] and [[ProxyTarget]] internal slots are set to *null* causing subsequent invocations of internal methods on that proxy object to throw a *TypeError* exception.</p>
    <p>Because proxy objects permit the implementation of internal methods to be provided by arbitrary ECMAScript code, it is possible to define a proxy object whose handler methods violates the invariants defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref>. Some of the internal method invariants defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods"></emu-xref> are essential integrity invariants. These invariants are explicitly enforced by the proxy object internal methods specified in this section. An ECMAScript implementation must be robust in the presence of all possible invariant violations.</p>
    <p>In the following algorithm descriptions, assume _O_ is an ECMAScript proxy object, _P_ is a property key value, _V_ is any ECMAScript language value and _Desc_ is a Property Descriptor record.</p>

      SourceCharacter ::

    </emu-grammar>
    <p>ECMAScript code is expressed using Unicode, version 8.0.0 or later. ECMAScript source text is a sequence of code points. All Unicode code point values from U+0000 to U+10FFFF, including surrogate code points, may occur in source text where permitted by the ECMAScript grammars. The actual encodings used to store and interchange ECMAScript source text is not relevant to this specification. Regardless of the external source text encoding, a conforming ECMAScript implementation processes the source text as if it was an equivalent sequence of |SourceCharacter| values, each |SourceCharacter| being a Unicode code point. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalization of source text, or behave as though they were performing normalization of source text.</p>
    <p>The components of a combining character sequence are treated as individual Unicode code points even though a user might think of the whole sequence as a single character.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>In string literals, regular expression literals, template literals and identifiers, any Unicode code point may also be expressed using Unicode escape sequences that explicitly express a code point's numeric value. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored as part of the comment.</p>
      <p>ECMAScript differs from the Java programming language in the behaviour of Unicode escape sequences. In a Java program, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A`, for example, occurs within a single-line comment, it is interpreted as a line terminator (Unicode code point U+000A is LINE FEED (LF)) and therefore the next code point is not part of the comment. Similarly, if the Unicode escape sequence `\\u000A` occurs within a string literal in a Java program, it is likewise interpreted as a line terminator, which is not allowed within a string literal&mdash;one must write `\\n` instead of `\\u000A` to cause a LINE FEED (LF) to be part of the String value of a string literal. In an ECMAScript program, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a comment is never interpreted and therefore cannot contribute to termination of the comment. Similarly, a Unicode escape sequence occurring within a string literal in an ECMAScript program always contributes to the literal and is never interpreted as a line terminator or as a code point that might terminate the string literal.</p>

  <p>There are several situations where the identification of lexical input elements is sensitive to the syntactic grammar context that is consuming the input elements.

The |InputElementRegExp| goal symbol is used in all syntactic grammar contexts where a |RegularExpressionLiteral| is permitted but neither a |TemplateMiddle|, nor a |TemplateTail| is permitted.

This is not affected by semicolon insertion (see <emu-xref href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>); in examples such as the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
a = b
/hi/g.exec(c).map(d);
    </code></pre>
    <p>where the first non-whitespace, non-comment code point after a |LineTerminator| is U+002F (SOLIDUS) and the syntactic context allows division or division-assignment, no semicolon is inserted at the |LineTerminator|. That is, the above example is interpreted in the same way as:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
a = b / hi / g.exec(c).map(d);
    </code></pre>

    <h1>Unicode Format-Control Characters</h1>
    <p>The Unicode format-control characters (i.e., the characters in category &ldquo;Cf&rdquo; in the Unicode Character Database such as LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK or RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK) are control codes used to control the formatting of a range of text in the absence of higher-level protocols for this (such as mark-up languages).</p>
    <p>It is useful to allow format-control characters in source text to facilitate editing and display. All format control characters may be used within comments, and within string literals, template literals, and regular expression literals.</p>
    <p>U+200C (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER) are format-control characters that are used to make necessary distinctions when forming words or phrases in certain languages. In ECMAScript source text these code points may also be used in an |IdentifierName| after the first character.</p>
    <p>U+FEFF (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE) is a format-control character used primarily at the start of a text to mark it as Unicode and to allow detection of the text's encoding and byte order. &lt;ZWNBSP&gt; characters intended for this purpose can sometimes also appear after the start of a text, for example as a result of concatenating files. In ECMAScript source text &lt;ZWNBSP&gt; code points are treated as white space characters (see <emu-xref href="#sec-white-space"></emu-xref>).</p>
    <p>The special treatment of certain format-control characters outside of comments, string literals, and regular expression literals is summarized in <emu-xref href="#table-31"></emu-xref>.</p>

    <h1>Line Terminators</h1>
    <p>Like white space code points, line terminator code points are used to improve source text readability and to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other. However, unlike white space code points, line terminators have some influence over the behaviour of the syntactic grammar. In general, line terminators may occur between any two tokens, but there are a few places where they are forbidden by the syntactic grammar. Line terminators also affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion (<emu-xref href="#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>). A line terminator cannot occur within any token except a |StringLiteral|, |Template|, or |TemplateSubstitutionTail|. Line terminators may only occur within a |StringLiteral| token as part of a |LineContinuation|.</p>

    <p>Comments can be either single or multi-line. Multi-line comments cannot nest.</p>
    <p>Because a single-line comment can contain any Unicode code point except a |LineTerminator| code point, and because of the general rule that a token is always as long as possible, a single-line comment always consists of all code points from the `//` marker to the end of the line.

    <p>|IdentifierName| and |ReservedWord| are tokens that are interpreted according to the Default Identifier Syntax given in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Identifier and Pattern Syntax, with some small modifications. |ReservedWord| is an enumerated subset of |IdentifierName|. The syntactic grammar defines |Identifier| as an |IdentifierName| that is not a |ReservedWord|. The Unicode identifier grammar is based on character properties specified by the Unicode Standard. The Unicode code points in the specified categories in version 8.0.0 of the Unicode standard must be treated as in those categories by all conforming ECMAScript implementations. ECMAScript implementations may recognize identifier code points defined in later editions of the Unicode Standard.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>This standard specifies specific code point additions: U+0024 (DOLLAR SIGN) and U+005F (LOW LINE) are permitted anywhere in an |IdentifierName|, and the code points U+200C (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER) are permitted anywhere after the first code point of an |IdentifierName|.</p>
    </emu-note>
    <p>Unicode escape sequences are permitted in an |IdentifierName|, where they contribute a single Unicode code point to the |IdentifierName|. The code point is expressed by the |HexDigits| of the |UnicodeEscapeSequence| (see <emu-xref href="#sec-literals-string-literals"></emu-xref>). The `\\` preceding the |UnicodeEscapeSequence| and the `u` and `{ }` code units, if they appear, do not contribute code points to the |IdentifierName|. A |UnicodeEscapeSequence| cannot be used to put a code point into an |IdentifierName| that would otherwise be illegal. In other words, if a `\\` |UnicodeEscapeSequence| sequence were replaced by the |SourceCharacter| it contributes, the result must still be a valid |IdentifierName| that has the exact same sequence of |SourceCharacter| elements as the original |IdentifierName|. All interpretations of |IdentifierName| within this specification are based upon their actual code points regardless of whether or not an escape sequence was used to contribute any particular code point.</p>

All code points may appear literally in a string literal except for the closing quote code points, U+005C (REVERSE SOLIDUS), U+000D (CARRIAGE RETURN), U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR), U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR), and U+000A (LINE FEED). Any code points may appear in the form of an escape sequence. String literals evaluate to ECMAScript String values. When generating these String values Unicode code points are UTF-16 encoded as defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-utf16encoding"></emu-xref>. Code points belonging to the Basic Multilingual Plane are encoded as a single code unit element of the string. All other code points are encoded as two code unit elements of the string.</p>

        <p>A regular expression literal is an input element that is converted to a RegExp object (see <emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-regular-expression-objects"></emu-xref>) each time the literal is evaluated. Two regular expression literals in a program evaluate to regular expression objects that never compare as `===` to each other even if the two literals' contents are identical. A RegExp object may also be created at runtime by `new RegExp` or calling the `RegExp` constructor as a function (see <emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-constructor"></emu-xref>).</p>
      </emu-note>
      <p>The productions below describe the syntax for a regular expression literal and are used by the input element scanner to find the end of the regular expression literal. The source text comprising the |RegularExpressionBody| and the |RegularExpressionFlags| are subsequently parsed again using the more stringent ECMAScript Regular Expression grammar (<emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>).</p>
      <p>An implementation may extend the ECMAScript Regular Expression grammar defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-patterns"></emu-xref>, but it must not extend the |RegularExpressionBody| and |RegularExpressionFlags| productions defined below or the productions used by these productions.</p>

        <h1>Static Semantics: TV and TRV</h1>
        <p>A template literal component is interpreted as a sequence of Unicode code points.

  <emu-clause id="sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">
    <h1>Automatic Semicolon Insertion</h1>
    <p>Most ECMAScript statements and declarations must be terminated with a semicolon. Such semicolons may always appear explicitly in the source text. For convenience, however, such semicolons may be omitted from the source text in certain situations. These situations are described by saying that semicolons are automatically inserted into the source code token stream in those situations.</p>

    <!-- es6num="11.9.1" -->
    <emu-clause id="sec-rules-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion">
      <h1>Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion</h1>
      <p>In the following rules, &ldquo;token&rdquo; means the actual recognized lexical token determined using the current lexical goal symbol as described in clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-lexical-grammar"></emu-xref>.</p>
      <p>There are three basic rules of semicolon insertion:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>When, as a |Script| or |Module| is parsed from left to right, a token (called the <em>offending token</em>) is encountered that is not allowed by any production of the grammar, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the offending token if one or more of the following conditions is true:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The offending token is separated from the previous token by at least one |LineTerminator|.
            </li>
            <li>
              The offending token is `}`.
            </li>
            <li>
              The previous token is `)` and the inserted semicolon would then be parsed as the terminating semicolon of a do-while statement (<emu-xref href="#sec-do-while-statement"></emu-xref>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          When, as the |Script| or |Module| is parsed from left to right, the end of the input stream of tokens is encountered and the parser is unable to parse the input token stream as a single complete ECMAScript |Script| or |Module|, then a semicolon is automatically inserted at the end of the input stream.
        </li>
        <li>
          When, as the |Script| or |Module| is parsed from left to right, a token is encountered that is allowed by some production of the grammar, but the production is a <em>restricted production</em> and the token would be the first token for a terminal or nonterminal immediately following the annotation &ldquo;[no |LineTerminator| here]&rdquo; within the restricted production (and therefore such a token is called a restricted token), and the restricted token is separated from the previous token by at least one |LineTerminator|, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the restricted token.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, there is an additional overriding condition on the preceding rules: a semicolon is never inserted automatically if the semicolon would then be parsed as an empty statement or if that semicolon would become one of the two semicolons in the header of a `for` statement (see <emu-xref href="#sec-for-statement"></emu-xref>).</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The following are the only restricted productions in the grammar:</p>
        <emu-grammar>
          UpdateExpression[Yield] :
            LeftHandSideExpression[?Yield] [no LineTerminator here] `++`
            LeftHandSideExpression[?Yield] [no LineTerminator here] `--`

          ContinueStatement[Yield] :
            `continue` `;`
            `continue` [no LineTerminator here] LabelIdentifier[?Yield] `;`

          BreakStatement[Yield] :
            `break` `;`
            `break` [no LineTerminator here] LabelIdentifier[?Yield] `;`

          ReturnStatement[Yield] :
            `return` `;`
            `return` [no LineTerminator here] Expression[In, ?Yield] `;`

          ThrowStatement[Yield] :
            `throw` [no LineTerminator here] Expression[In, ?Yield] `;`

          ArrowFunction[In, Yield] :
            ArrowParameters[?Yield] [no LineTerminator here] `=&gt;` ConciseBody[?In]

          YieldExpression[In] :
            `yield` [no LineTerminator here] `*` AssignmentExpression[?In, Yield]
            `yield` [no LineTerminator here] AssignmentExpression[?In, Yield]
        </emu-grammar>
        <p>The practical effect of these restricted productions is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a `++` or `--` token is encountered where the parser would treat it as a postfix operator, and at least one |LineTerminator| occurred between the preceding token and the `++` or `--` token, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the `++` or `--` token.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a `continue`, `break`, `return`, `throw`, or `yield` token is encountered and a |LineTerminator| is encountered before the next token, a semicolon is automatically inserted after the `continue`, `break`, `return`, `throw`, or `yield` token.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The resulting practical advice to ECMAScript programmers is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A postfix `++` or `--` operator should appear on the same line as its operand.
          </li>
          <li>
            An |Expression| in a `return` or `throw` statement or an |AssignmentExpression| in a `yield` expression should start on the same line as the `return`, `throw`, or `yield` token.
          </li>
          <li>
            A |LabelIdentifier| in a `break` or `continue` statement should be on the same line as the `break` or `continue` token.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Given the above definition of equality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            String comparison can be forced by: `"" + a == "" + b`.
          </li>
          <li>
            Numeric comparison can be forced by: `+a == +b`.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boolean comparison can be forced by: `!a == !b`.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>The equality operators maintain the following invariants:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `A != B` is equivalent to `!(A == B)`.
          </li>
          <li>
            `A == B` is equivalent to `B == A`, except in the order of evaluation of `A` and `B`.

      <emu-note>
        <p>The equality operator is not always transitive. For example, there might be two distinct String objects, each representing the same String value; each String object would be considered equal to the String value by the `==` operator, but the two String objects would not be equal to each other. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `new String("a") == "a"` and `"a" == new String("a")` are both *true*.
          </li>
          <li>
            `new String("a") == new String("a")` is *false*.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </emu-note>
      <emu-note>
        <p>Comparison of Strings uses a simple equality test on sequences of code unit values. There is no attempt to use the more complex, semantically oriented definitions of character or string equality and collating order defined in the Unicode specification. Therefore Strings values that are canonically equal according to the Unicode standard could test as unequal. In effect this algorithm assumes that both Strings are already in normalized form.</p>

        <p>When the abstract operation EnumerateObjectProperties is called with argument _O_, the following steps are taken:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Assert: Type(_O_) is Object.
          1. Return an Iterator object (<emu-xref href="#sec-iterator-interface"></emu-xref>) whose `next` method iterates over all the String-valued keys of enumerable properties of _O_. The iterator object is never directly accessible to ECMAScript code. The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified but must conform to the rules specified below.
        </emu-alg>
        <p>The iterator's `throw` and `return` methods are *null* and are never invoked. The iterator's `next` method processes object properties to determine whether the property key should be returned as an iterator value. Returned property keys do not include keys that are Symbols. Properties of the target object may be deleted during enumeration. A property that is deleted before it is processed by the iterator's `next` method is ignored. If new properties are added to the target object during enumeration, the newly added properties are not guaranteed to be processed in the active enumeration. A property name will be returned by the iterator's `next` method at most once in any enumeration.</p>
        <p>Enumerating the properties of the target object includes enumerating properties of its prototype, and the prototype of the prototype, and so on, recursively; but a property of a prototype is not processed if it has the same name as a property that has already been processed by the iterator's `next` method. The values of [[Enumerable]] attributes are not considered when determining if a property of a prototype object has already been processed. The enumerable property names of prototype objects must be obtained by invoking EnumerateObjectProperties passing the prototype object as the argument. EnumerateObjectProperties must obtain the own property keys of the target object by calling its [[OwnPropertyKeys]] internal method. Property attributes of the target object must be obtained by calling its [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method.</p>
        <emu-note>
          <p>The following is an informative definition of an ECMAScript generator function that conforms to these rules:</p>

      <p>A |Statement| may be prefixed by a label. Labelled statements are only used in conjunction with labelled `break` and `continue` statements. ECMAScript has no `goto` statement. A |Statement| can be part of a |LabelledStatement|, which itself can be part of a |LabelledStatement|, and so on. The labels introduced this way are collectively referred to as the &ldquo;current label set&rdquo; when describing the semantics of individual statements.</p>

          <emu-alg>
            1. Assert: _sourceText_ is an ECMAScript source text (see clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-source-code"></emu-xref>).
            1. Parse _sourceText_ using |Module| as the goal symbol and analyze the parse result for any Early Error conditions. If the parse was successful and no early errors were found, let _body_ be the resulting parse tree. Otherwise, let _body_ be a List of one or more *SyntaxError* or *ReferenceError* objects representing the parsing errors and/or early errors. Parsing and early error detection may be interweaved in an implementation dependent manner. If more than one parsing error or early error is present, the number and ordering of error objects in the list is implementation dependent, but at least one must be present.

                1. If _ee_.[[LocalName]] is not an element of _importedBoundNames_, then
                  1. Append _ee_ to _localExportEntries_.

                  1. If _ie_.[[ImportName]] is `"*"`, then
                    1. Assert: this is a re-export of an imported module namespace object.
                    1. Append _ee_ to _localExportEntries_.

  <h1>Error Handling and Language Extensions</h1>
  <p>An implementation must report most errors at the time the relevant ECMAScript language construct is evaluated. An <dfn id="early-error">early error</dfn> is an error that can be detected and reported prior to the evaluation of any construct in the |Script| containing the error. The presence of an early error prevents the evaluation of the construct. An implementation must report early errors in a |Script| as part of parsing that |Script| in ParseScript. Early errors in a |Module| are reported at the point when the |Module| would be evaluated and the |Module| is never initialized. Early errors in <b>eval</b> code are reported at the time `eval` is called and prevent evaluation of the <b>eval</b> code. All errors that are not early errors are runtime errors.</p>
  <p>An implementation must report as an early error any occurrence of a condition that is listed in a &ldquo;Static Semantics: Early Errors&rdquo; subclause of this specification.</p>
  <p>An implementation shall not treat other kinds of errors as early errors even if the compiler can prove that a construct cannot execute without error under any circumstances. An implementation may issue an early warning in such a case, but it should not report the error until the relevant construct is actually executed.</p>
  <p>An implementation shall report all errors as specified, except for the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Except as restricted in <emu-xref href="#sec-forbidden-extensions"></emu-xref>, an implementation may extend |Script| syntax, |Module| syntax, and regular expression pattern or flag syntax. To permit this, all operations (such as calling `eval`, using a regular expression literal, or using the `Function` or `RegExp` constructor) that are allowed to throw *SyntaxError* are permitted to exhibit implementation-defined behaviour instead of throwing *SyntaxError* when they encounter an implementation-defined extension to the script syntax or regular expression pattern or flag syntax.
    </li>
    <li>
      Except as restricted in <emu-xref href="#sec-forbidden-extensions"></emu-xref>, an implementation may provide additional types, values, objects, properties, and functions beyond those described in this specification.

Such own properties also must not be created for function objects defined using an |ArrowFunction|, |MethodDefinition|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |GeneratorExpression|, |ClassDeclaration|, or |ClassExpression| regardless of whether the definition is contained in strict mode code. Built-in functions, strict mode functions created using the `Function` constructor, generator functions created using the `Generator` constructor, and functions created using the `bind` method also must not be created with such own properties.

        If an implementation extends non-strict or built-in function objects with an own property named `"caller"` the value of that property, as observed using [[Get]] or [[GetOwnProperty]], must not be a strict function object.

<emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-standard-built-in-objects">
  <h1>ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects</h1>
  <p>There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript |Script| or |Module| begins execution. One, the global object, is part of the lexical environment of the executing program. Others are accessible as initial properties of the global object or indirectly as properties of accessible built-in objects.</p>
  <p>Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function is a built-in Function object with the characteristics described in <emu-xref href="#sec-built-in-function-objects"></emu-xref>. Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]] internal slot of a built-in object initially has the value *true*. Every built-in Function object has a [[Realm]] internal slot whose value is the Realm Record of the realm for which the object was initially created.</p>
  <p>Many built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with arguments. Some of them furthermore are constructors: they are functions intended for use with the `new` operator. For each built-in function, this specification describes the arguments required by that function and the properties of that function object. For each built-in constructor, this specification furthermore describes properties of the prototype object of that constructor and properties of specific object instances returned by a `new` expression that invokes that constructor.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function or constructor is given fewer arguments than the function is specified to require, the function or constructor shall behave exactly as if it had been given sufficient additional arguments, each such argument being the *undefined* value. Such missing arguments are considered to be &ldquo;not present&rdquo; and may be identified in that manner by specification algorithms. In the description of a particular function, the terms &ldquo;`this` value&rdquo; and &ldquo;NewTarget&rdquo; have the meanings given in <emu-xref href="#sec-built-in-function-objects"></emu-xref>.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function, if a built-in function or constructor described is given more arguments than the function is specified to allow, the extra arguments are evaluated by the call and then ignored by the function. However, an implementation may define implementation specific behaviour relating to such arguments as long as the behaviour is not the throwing of a *TypeError* exception that is predicated simply on the presence of an extra argument.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>Implementations that add additional capabilities to the set of built-in functions are encouraged to do so by adding new functions rather than adding new parameters to existing functions.</p>
  </emu-note>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in constructor has the Function prototype object, which is the initial value of the expression `Function.prototype` (<emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-function-prototype-object"></emu-xref>), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified every built-in prototype object has the Object prototype object, which is the initial value of the expression `Object.prototype` (<emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-object-prototype-object"></emu-xref>), as the value of its [[Prototype]] internal slot, except the Object prototype object itself.</p>
  <p>Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular function.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, each built-in function defined in this specification is created as if by calling the CreateBuiltinFunction abstract operation (<emu-xref href="#sec-createbuiltinfunction"></emu-xref>).</p>
  <p>Every built-in Function object, including constructors, has a `length` property whose value is an integer. Unless otherwise specified, this value is equal to the largest number of named arguments shown in the subclause headings for the function description. Optional parameters (which are indicated with brackets: `[` `]`) or rest parameters (which are shown using the form &laquo;...name&raquo;) are not included in the default argument count.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>For example, the function object that is the initial value of the `map` property of the Array prototype object is described under the subclause heading &laquo;Array.prototype.map (callbackFn [ , thisArg])&raquo; which shows the two named arguments callbackFn and thisArg, the latter being optional; therefore the value of the `length` property of that Function object is `1`.</p>
  </emu-note>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the `length` property of a built-in Function object has the attributes { [[Writable]]: *false*, [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* }.</p>
  <p>Every built-in Function object, including constructors, that is not identified as an anonymous function has a `name` property whose value is a String. Unless otherwise specified, this value is the name that is given to the function in this specification. For functions that are specified as properties of objects, the name value is the property name string used to access the function. Functions that are specified as get or set accessor functions of built-in properties have `"get "` or `"set "` prepended to the property name string. The value of the `name` property is explicitly specified for each built-in functions whose property key is a Symbol value.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise specified, the `name` property of a built-in Function object, if it exists, has the attributes { [[Writable]]: *false*, [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* }.</p>
  <p>Every other data property described in clauses 18 through 26 and in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-additional-built-in-properties"></emu-xref> has the attributes { [[Writable]]: *true*, [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* } unless otherwise specified.</p>
  <p>Every accessor property described in clauses 18 through 26 and in Annex <emu-xref href="#sec-additional-built-in-properties"></emu-xref> has the attributes { [[Enumerable]]: *false*, [[Configurable]]: *true* } unless otherwise specified. If only a get accessor function is described, the set accessor function is the default value, *undefined*. If only a set accessor is described the get accessor is the default value, *undefined*.</p>

        <p>When a code unit to be included in a URI is not listed above or is not intended to have the special meaning sometimes given to the reserved code units, that code unit must be encoded. The code unit is transformed into its UTF-8 encoding, with surrogate pairs first converted from UTF-16 to the corresponding code point value. (Note that for code units in the range [0,127] this results in a single octet with the same value.) The resulting sequence of octets is then transformed into a String with each octet represented by an escape sequence of the form `"%xx"`.</p>

        <h1>String.prototype.localeCompare ( _that_ [ , _reserved1_ [ , _reserved2_ ] ] )</h1>
        <p>An ECMAScript implementation that includes the ECMA-402 Internationalization API must implement the `localeCompare` method as specified in the ECMA-402 specification. If an ECMAScript implementation does not include the ECMA-402 API the following specification of the `localeCompare` method is used.</p>
        <p>When the `localeCompare` method is called with argument _that_, it returns a Number other than *NaN* that represents the result of a locale-sensitive String comparison of the *this* value (converted to a String) with _that_ (converted to a String). The two Strings are _S_ and _That_. The two Strings are compared in an implementation-defined fashion. The result is intended to order String values in the sort order specified by a host default locale, and will be negative, zero, or positive, depending on whether _S_ comes before _That_ in the sort order, the Strings are equal, or _S_ comes after _That_ in the sort order, respectively.</p>
        <p>Before performing the comparisons, the following steps are performed to prepare the Strings:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Let _O_ be ? RequireObjectCoercible(*this* value).
          1. Let _S_ be ? ToString(_O_).
          1. Let _That_ be ? ToString(_that_).
        </emu-alg>
        <p>The meaning of the optional second and third parameters to this method are defined in the ECMA-402 specification; implementations that do not include ECMA-402 support must not assign any other interpretation to those parameter positions.</p>
        <p>The `localeCompare` method, if considered as a function of two arguments *this* and _that_, is a consistent comparison function (as defined in <emu-xref href="#sec-array.prototype.sort"></emu-xref>) on the set of all Strings.</p>
        <p>The actual return values are implementation-defined to permit implementers to encode additional information in the value, but the function is required to define a total ordering on all Strings. This function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical and must return `0` when comparing Strings that are considered canonically equivalent.</p>
        <emu-note>
          <p>The `localeCompare` method itself is not directly suitable as an argument to `Array.prototype.sort` because the latter requires a function of two arguments.</p>
        </emu-note>
        <emu-note>
          <p>This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive comparison functionality is available to the ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare according to the rules of the host environment's current locale. However, regardless of the host provided comparison capabilities, this function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical. It is recommended that this function should not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or decompositions. For a definition and discussion of canonical equivalence see the Unicode Standard, chapters 2 and 3, as well as Unicode Standard Annex #15, Unicode Normalization Forms (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/</a>) and Unicode Technical Note #5, Canonical Equivalence in Applications (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/">http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/</a>).

      <h1>Pattern Semantics</h1>
      <p>A regular expression pattern is converted into an internal procedure using the process described below. An implementation is encouraged to use more efficient algorithms than the ones listed below, as long as the results are the same. The internal procedure is used as the value of a RegExp object's [[RegExpMatcher]] internal slot.</p>
      <p>A |Pattern| is either a BMP pattern or a Unicode pattern depending upon whether or not its associated flags contain a `"u"`. A BMP pattern matches against a String interpreted as consisting of a sequence of 16-bit values that are Unicode code points in the range of the Basic Multilingual Plane. A Unicode pattern matches against a String interpreted as consisting of Unicode code points encoded using UTF-16. In the context of describing the behaviour of a BMP pattern &ldquo;character&rdquo; means a single 16-bit Unicode BMP code point. In the context of describing the behaviour of a Unicode pattern &ldquo;character&rdquo; means a UTF-16 encoded code point (<emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-types-string-type"></emu-xref>). In either context, &ldquo;character value&rdquo; means the numeric value of the corresponding non-encoded code point.</p>
      <p>The syntax and semantics of |Pattern| is defined as if the source code for the |Pattern| was a List of |SourceCharacter| values where each |SourceCharacter| corresponds to a Unicode code point. If a BMP pattern contains a non-BMP |SourceCharacter| the entire pattern is encoded using UTF-16 and the individual code units of that encoding are used as the elements of the List.</p>
      <emu-note>
        <p>For example, consider a pattern expressed in source text as the single non-BMP character U+1D11E (MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF). Interpreted as a Unicode pattern, it would be a single element (character) List consisting of the single code point 0x1D11E. However, interpreted as a BMP pattern, it is first UTF-16 encoded to produce a two element List consisting of the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E.</p>
        <p>Patterns are passed to the RegExp constructor as ECMAScript String values in which non-BMP characters are UTF-16 encoded. For example, the single character MUSICAL SYMBOL G CLEF pattern, expressed as a String value, is a String of length 2 whose elements were the code units 0xD834 and 0xDD1E. So no further translation of the string would be necessary to process it as a BMP pattern consisting of two pattern characters. However, to process it as a Unicode pattern UTF16Decode must be used in producing a List consisting of a single pattern character, the code point U+1D11E.</p>
        <p>An implementation may not actually perform such translations to or from UTF-16, but the semantics of this specification requires that the result of pattern matching be as if such translations were performed.</p>

        <p>The descriptions below use the following variables:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            _Input_ is a List consisting of all of the characters, in order, of the String being matched by the regular expression pattern. Each character is either a code unit or a code point, depending upon the kind of pattern involved. The notation _Input_[_n_] means the _n_<sup>th</sup> character of _Input_, where _n_ can range between 0 (inclusive) and _InputLength_ (exclusive).
          </li>
          <li>
            _InputLength_ is the number of characters in _Input_.
          </li>
          <li>
            _NcapturingParens_ is the total number of left capturing parentheses (i.e. the total number of times the <emu-grammar>Atom :: `(` Disjunction `)`</emu-grammar> production is expanded) in the pattern. A left capturing parenthesis is any `(` pattern character that is matched by the `(` terminal of the <emu-grammar>Atom :: `(` Disjunction `)`</emu-grammar> production.
          </li>
          <li>
            _IgnoreCase_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"i"` and otherwise is *false*.
          </li>
          <li>
            _Multiline_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"m"` and otherwise is *false*.
          </li>
          <li>
            _Unicode_ is *true* if the RegExp object's [[OriginalFlags]] internal slot contains `"u"` and otherwise is *false*.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore, the descriptions below use the following internal data structures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <em>CharSet</em> is a mathematical set of characters, either code units or code points depending up the state of the _Unicode_ flag. &ldquo;All characters&rdquo; means either all code unit values or all code point values also depending upon the state if _Unicode_.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>State</em> is an ordered pair (_endIndex_, _captures_) where _endIndex_ is an integer and _captures_ is a List of _NcapturingParens_ values. States are used to represent partial match states in the regular expression matching algorithms. The _endIndex_ is one plus the index of the last input character matched so far by the pattern, while _captures_ holds the results of capturing parentheses. The _n_<sup>th</sup> element of _captures_ is either a List that represents the value obtained by the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses or *undefined* if the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses hasn't been reached yet. Due to backtracking, many States may be in use at any time during the matching process.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>MatchResult</em> is either a State or the special token ~failure~ that indicates that the match failed.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>Continuation</em> procedure is an internal closure (i.e. an internal procedure with some arguments already bound to values) that takes one State argument and returns a MatchResult result. If an internal closure references variables which are bound in the function that creates the closure, the closure uses the values that these variables had at the time the closure was created. The Continuation attempts to match the remaining portion (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) of the pattern against _Input_, starting at the intermediate state given by its State argument. If the match succeeds, the Continuation returns the final State that it reached; if the match fails, the Continuation returns ~failure~.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <em>Matcher</em> procedure is an internal closure that takes two arguments &mdash; a State and a Continuation &mdash; and returns a MatchResult result. A Matcher attempts to match a middle subpattern (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) of the pattern against _Input_, starting at the intermediate state given by its State argument. The Continuation argument should be a closure that matches the rest of the pattern. After matching the subpattern of a pattern to obtain a new State, the Matcher then calls Continuation on that new State to test if the rest of the pattern can match as well. If it can, the Matcher returns the State returned by Continuation; if not, the Matcher may try different choices at its choice points, repeatedly calling Continuation until it either succeeds or all possibilities have been exhausted.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <em>AssertionTester</em> procedure is an internal closure that takes a State argument and returns a Boolean result. The assertion tester tests a specific condition (specified by the closure's already-bound arguments) against the current place in _Input_ and returns *true* if the condition matched or *false* if not.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <em>EscapeValue</em> is either a character or an integer. An EscapeValue is used to denote the interpretation of a |DecimalEscape| escape sequence: a character _ch_ means that the escape sequence is interpreted as the character _ch_, while an integer _n_ means that the escape sequence is interpreted as a backreference to the _n_<sup>th</sup> set of capturing parentheses.

            <p>An |Atom| followed by a |Quantifier| is repeated the number of times specified by the |Quantifier|. A |Quantifier| can be non-greedy, in which case the |Atom| pattern is repeated as few times as possible while still matching the sequel, or it can be greedy, in which case the |Atom| pattern is repeated as many times as possible while still matching the sequel. The |Atom| pattern is repeated rather than the input character sequence that it matches, so different repetitions of the |Atom| can match different input substrings.</p>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>If the |Atom| and the sequel of the regular expression all have choice points, the |Atom| is first matched as many (or as few, if non-greedy) times as possible. All choices in the sequel are tried before moving on to the next choice in the last repetition of |Atom|. All choices in the last (n<sup>th</sup>) repetition of |Atom| are tried before moving on to the next choice in the next-to-last (n-1)<sup>st</sup> repetition of |Atom|; at which point it may turn out that more or fewer repetitions of |Atom| are now possible; these are exhausted (again, starting with either as few or as many as possible) before moving on to the next choice in the (n-1)<sup>st</sup> repetition of |Atom| and so on.</p>
            <p>Compare</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/a[a-z]{2,4}/.exec("abcdefghi")</code></pre>
            <p>which returns `"abcde"` with</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/a[a-z]{2,4}?/.exec("abcdefghi")</code></pre>
            <p>which returns `"abc"`.</p>
            <p>Consider also</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(aa|aabaac|ba|b|c)*/.exec("aabaac")</code></pre>
            <p>which, by the choice point ordering above, returns the array</p>

            <pre><code class="javascript">
["aabaac", "aabaac"]
["aabaac", "c"]
            </code></pre>
            <p>The above ordering of choice points can be used to write a regular expression that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers (represented in unary notation). The following example calculates the gcd of 10 and 15:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">"aaaaaaaaaa,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".replace(/^(a+)\1*,\1+$/,"$1")</code></pre>
            <p>which returns the gcd in unary notation `"aaaaa"`.</p>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>Step 4 of the RepeatMatcher clears |Atom|'s captures each time |Atom| is repeated. We can see its behaviour in the regular expression</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(z)((a+)?(b+)?(c))*/.exec("zaacbbbcac")</code></pre>
            <p>which returns the array</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["zaacbbbcac", "z", "ac", "a", undefined, "c"]</code></pre>
            <p>and not</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["zaacbbbcac", "z", "ac", "a", "bbb", "c"]</code></pre>
            <p>because each iteration of the outermost `*` clears all captured Strings contained in the quantified |Atom|, which in this case includes capture Strings numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>Step 1 of the RepeatMatcher's _d_ closure states that, once the minimum number of repetitions has been satisfied, any more expansions of |Atom| that match the empty character sequence are not considered for further repetitions. This prevents the regular expression engine from falling into an infinite loop on patterns such as:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(a*)*/.exec("b")</code></pre>
            <p>or the slightly more complicated:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(a*)b\1+/.exec("baaaac")</code></pre>
            <p>which returns the array</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["b", ""]</code></pre>

            <p>Parentheses of the form `(` |Disjunction| `)` serve both to group the components of the |Disjunction| pattern together and to save the result of the match. The result can be used either in a backreference (`\\` followed by a nonzero decimal number), referenced in a replace String, or returned as part of an array from the regular expression matching internal procedure. To inhibit the capturing behaviour of parentheses, use the form `(?:` |Disjunction| `)` instead.</p>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>The form `(?=` |Disjunction| `)` specifies a zero-width positive lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside |Disjunction| must match at the current position, but the current position is not advanced before matching the sequel. If |Disjunction| can match at the current position in several ways, only the first one is tried. Unlike other regular expression operators, there is no backtracking into a `(?=` form (this unusual behaviour is inherited from Perl). This only matters when the |Disjunction| contains capturing parentheses and the sequel of the pattern contains backreferences to those captures.</p>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(?=(a+))/.exec("baaabac")</code></pre>
            <p>matches the empty String immediately after the first `b` and therefore returns the array:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["", "aaa"]</code></pre>
            <p>To illustrate the lack of backtracking into the lookahead, consider:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(?=(a+))a*b\1/.exec("baaabac")</code></pre>
            <p>This expression returns</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["aba", "a"]</code></pre>
            <p>and not:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["aaaba", "a"]</code></pre>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>The form `(?!` |Disjunction| `)` specifies a zero-width negative lookahead. In order for it to succeed, the pattern inside |Disjunction| must fail to match at the current position. The current position is not advanced before matching the sequel. |Disjunction| can contain capturing parentheses, but backreferences to them only make sense from within |Disjunction| itself. Backreferences to these capturing parentheses from elsewhere in the pattern always return *undefined* because the negative lookahead must fail for the pattern to succeed. For example,</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">/(.*?)a(?!(a+)b\2c)\2(.*)/.exec("baaabaac")</code></pre>
            <p>looks for an `a` not immediately followed by some positive number n of `a`'s, a `b`, another n `a`'s (specified by the first `\\2`) and a `c`. The second `\\2` is outside the negative lookahead, so it matches against *undefined* and therefore always succeeds. The whole expression returns the array:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">["baaabaac", "ba", undefined, "abaac"]</code></pre>
          </emu-note>
          <emu-note>
            <p>In case-insignificant matches when _Unicode_ is *true*, all characters are implicitly case-folded using the simple mapping provided by the Unicode standard immediately before they are compared. The simple mapping always maps to a single code point, so it does not map, for example, `"&szlig;"` (U+00DF) to `"SS"`. It may however map a code point outside the Basic Latin range to a character within, for example, `"&#x17f;"` (U+017F) to `"s"`. Such characters are not mapped if _Unicode_ is *false*. This prevents Unicode code points such as U+017F and U+212A from matching regular expressions such as `/[a-z]/i`, but they will match `/[a-z]/ui`.</p>

        <h1>RegExp.prototype [ @@split ] ( _string_, _limit_ )</h1>
        <emu-note>
          <p>Returns an Array object into which substrings of the result of converting _string_ to a String have been stored. The substrings are determined by searching from left to right for matches of the *this* value regular expression; these occurrences are not part of any substring in the returned array, but serve to divide up the String value.</p>
          <p>The *this* value may be an empty regular expression or a regular expression that can match an empty String. In this case, the regular expression does not match the empty substring at the beginning or end of the input String, nor does it match the empty substring at the end of the previous separator match. (For example, if the regular expression matches the empty String, the String is split up into individual code unit elements; the length of the result array equals the length of the String, and each substring contains one code unit.) Only the first match at a given index of the String is considered, even if backtracking could yield a non-empty-substring match at that index. (For example, `/a*?/[Symbol.split]("ab")` evaluates to the array `["a","b"]`, while `/a*/[Symbol.split]("ab")` evaluates to the array `["","b"]`.)</p>
          <p>If the _string_ is (or converts to) the empty String, the result depends on whether the regular expression can match the empty String. If it can, the result array contains no elements. Otherwise, the result array contains one element, which is the empty String.</p>
          <p>If the regular expression contains capturing parentheses, then each time _separator_ is matched the results (including any *undefined* results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced into the output array. For example,</p>
          <pre><code class="javascript">/&lt;(\/)?([^&lt;&gt;]+)&gt;/[Symbol.split]("A&lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;and&lt;CODE&gt;coded&lt;/CODE&gt;")</code></pre>
          <p>evaluates to the array</p>
          <pre><code class="javascript">["A",undefined,"B","bold","/","B","and",undefined,"CODE","coded","/","CODE",""]</code></pre>
          <p>If _limit_ is not *undefined*, then the output array is truncated so that it contains no more than _limit_ elements.</p>

When called as a constructor it creates and initializes a new exotic Array object. When `Array` is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it also creates and initializes a new Array object. Thus the function call `Array(&hellip;)` is equivalent to the object creation expression `new Array(&hellip;)` with the same arguments.</p>
      <p>The `Array` constructor is a single function whose behaviour is overloaded based upon the number and types of its arguments.</p>
      <p>The `Array` constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the value of an `extends` clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that intend to inherit the exotic `Array` behaviour must include a `super` call to the `Array` constructor to initialize subclass instances that are exotic Array objects. However, most of the `Array.prototype` methods are generic methods that are not dependent upon their `this` value being an exotic Array object.</p>

          <li>
            If _comparefn_ is *undefined* and the application of ToString to any value passed as an argument to SortCompare modifies _obj_ or any object on _obj_'s prototype chain.

        <p>The following steps are taken:</p>
        <emu-alg>
          1. Perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the [[Get]] and [[Set]] internal methods of _obj_, to the DeletePropertyOrThrow and HasOwnProperty abstract operation with _obj_ as the first argument, and to SortCompare (described below), such that:
            * The property key argument for each call to [[Get]], [[Set]], HasOwnProperty, or DeletePropertyOrThrow is the string representation of a nonnegative integer less than _len_.
            * The arguments for calls to SortCompare are values returned by a previous call to the [[Get]] internal method, unless the properties accessed by those previous calls did not exist according to HasOwnProperty. If both perspective arguments to SortCompare correspond to non-existent properties, use *+0* instead of calling SortCompare. If only the first perspective argument is non-existent use +1. If only the second perspective argument is non-existent use -1.
            * If _obj_ is not sparse then DeletePropertyOrThrow must not be called.
            * If any [[Set]] call returns *false* a *TypeError* exception is thrown.
            * If an abrupt completion is returned from any of these operations, it is immediately returned as the value of this function.
          1. Return _obj_.
        </emu-alg>
        <p>Unless the sort order is specified above to be implementation-defined, the returned object must have the following two characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There must be some mathematical permutation &pi; of the nonnegative integers less than _len_, such that for every nonnegative integer _j_ less than _len_, if property <emu-eqn>old[_j_]</emu-eqn> existed, then <emu-eqn>new[&pi;(_j_)]</emu-eqn> is exactly the same value as <emu-eqn>old[_j_]</emu-eqn>. But if property <emu-eqn>old[_j_]</emu-eqn> did not exist, then <emu-eqn>new[&pi;(_j_)]</emu-eqn> does not exist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then for all nonnegative integers _j_ and _k_, each less than _len_, if <emu-eqn>SortCompare(old[_j_], old[_k_]) &lt; 0</emu-eqn> (see SortCompare below), then <emu-eqn>new[&pi;(_j_)] &lt; new[&pi;(_k_)]</emu-eqn>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here the notation <emu-eqn>old[_j_]</emu-eqn> is used to refer to the hypothetical result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of _obj_ with argument _j_ before this function is executed, and the notation <emu-eqn>new[_j_]</emu-eqn> to refer to the hypothetical result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of _obj_ with argument _j_ after this function has been executed.</p>
        <p>A function _comparefn_ is a consistent comparison function for a set of values _S_ if all of the requirements below are met for all values _a_, _b_, and _c_ (possibly the same value) in the set _S_: The notation <emu-eqn>_a_ &lt;<sub>CF</sub> _b_</emu-eqn> means <emu-eqn>_comparefn_(_a_, _b_) &lt; 0</emu-eqn>; <emu-eqn>_a_ =<sub>CF</sub> _b_</emu-eqn> means <emu-eqn>_comparefn_(_a_, _b_) = 0</emu-eqn> (of either sign); and <emu-eqn>_a_ &gt;<sub>CF</sub> _b_</emu-eqn> means <emu-eqn>_comparefn_(_a_, _b_) &gt; 0</emu-eqn>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Calling _comparefn_(_a_, _b_) always returns the same value _v_ when given a specific pair of values _a_ and _b_ as its two arguments. Furthermore, Type(_v_) is Number, and _v_ is not *NaN*. Note that this implies that exactly one of _a_ &lt;<sub>CF</sub> _b_, _a_ =<sub>CF</sub> _b_, and _a_ &gt;<sub>CF</sub> _b_ will be true for a given pair of _a_ and _b_.
          </li>

            _a_ =<sub>CF</sub> _a_ (reflexivity)

    <h1>WeakMap Objects</h1>
    <p>WeakMap objects are collections of key/value pairs where the keys are objects and values may be arbitrary ECMAScript language values. A WeakMap may be queried to see if it contains a key/value pair with a specific key, but no mechanism is provided for enumerating the objects it holds as keys. If an object that is being used as the key of a WeakMap key/value pair is only reachable by following a chain of references that start within that WeakMap, then that key/value pair is inaccessible and is automatically removed from the WeakMap. WeakMap implementations must detect and remove such key/value pairs and any associated resources.</p>
    <p>An implementation may impose an arbitrarily determined latency between the time a key/value pair of a WeakMap becomes inaccessible and the time when the key/value pair is removed from the WeakMap. If this latency was observable to ECMAScript program, it would be a source of indeterminacy that could impact program execution. For that reason, an ECMAScript implementation must not provide any means to observe a key of a WeakMap that does not require the observer to present the observed key.</p>
    <p>WeakMap objects must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of key/value pairs in the collection. The data structure used in this WeakMap objects specification are only intended to describe the required observable semantics of WeakMap objects. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.</p>
    <emu-note>
      <p>WeakMap and WeakSets are intended to provide mechanisms for dynamically associating state with an object in a manner that does not &ldquo;leak&rdquo; memory resources if, in the absence of the WeakMap or WeakSet, the object otherwise became inaccessible and subject to resource reclamation by the implementation's garbage collection mechanisms. This characteristic can be achieved by using an inverted per-object mapping of weak map instances to keys. Alternatively each weak map may internally store its key to value mappings but this approach requires coordination between the WeakMap or WeakSet implementation and the garbage collector. The following references describe mechanism that may be useful to implementations of WeakMap and WeakSets:</p>

  <h1>Additional ECMAScript Features for Web Browsers</h1>
  <p>The ECMAScript language syntax and semantics defined in this annex are required when the ECMAScript host is a web browser. The content of this annex is normative but optional if the ECMAScript host is not a web browser.</p>
  <emu-note>
    <p>This annex describes various legacy features and other characteristics of web browser based ECMAScript implementations. All of the language features and behaviours specified in this annex have one or more undesirable characteristics and in the absence of legacy usage would be removed from this specification. However, the usage of these features by large numbers of existing web pages means that web browsers must continue to support them. The specifications in this annex define the requirements for interoperable implementations of these legacy features.</p>
    <p>These features are not considered part of the core ECMAScript language. Programmers should not use or assume the existence of these features and behaviours when writing new ECMAScript code. ECMAScript implementations are discouraged from implementing these features unless the implementation is part of a web browser or is required to run the same legacy ECMAScript code that web browsers encounter.</p>

      <p>ECMAScript 2015 interoperability for the second and third use cases requires the following extensions to the clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ordinary-and-exotic-objects-behaviours"></emu-xref>, clause <emu-xref href="#sec-ecmascript-language-functions-and-classes"></emu-xref>, clause <emu-xref href="#sec-eval-x"></emu-xref> and clause <emu-xref href="#sec-globaldeclarationinstantiation"></emu-xref> semantics.</p>
      <p>If an ECMAScript implementation has a mechanism for reporting diagnostic warning messages, a warning should be produced when code contains a |FunctionDeclaration| for which these compatibility semantics are applied and introduce observable differences from non-compatibility semantics. For example, if a var binding is not introduced because its introduction would create an early error, a warning message should not be produced.</p>

  <h1>Corrections and Clarifications in ECMAScript 2015 with Possible Compatibility Impact</h1>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-candeclareglobalvar"></emu-xref>-<emu-xref href="#sec-createglobalfunctionbinding"></emu-xref> Edition 5 and 5.1 used a property existence test to determine whether a global object property corresponding to a new global declaration already existed. ECMAScript 2015 uses an own property existence test. This corresponds to what has been most commonly implemented by web browsers.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-array-exotic-objects-defineownproperty-p-desc"></emu-xref>: The 5<sup>th</sup> Edition moved the capture of the current array length prior to the integer conversion of the array index or new length value. However, the captured length value could become invalid if the conversion process has the side-effect of changing the array length. ECMAScript 2015 specifies that the current array length must be captured after the possible occurrence of such side-effects.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-timeclip"></emu-xref>: Previous editions permitted the TimeClip abstract operation to return either *+0* or *-0* as the representation of a 0 time value. ECMAScript 2015 specifies that *+0* always returned. This means that for ECMAScript 2015 the time value of a Date object is never observably *-0* and methods that return time values never return *-0*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref>: If a time zone offset is not present, the local time zone is used. Edition 5.1 incorrectly stated that a missing time zone should be interpreted as `"z"`.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-date.prototype.toisostring"></emu-xref>: If the year cannot be represented using the Date Time String Format specified in <emu-xref href="#sec-date-time-string-format"></emu-xref> a RangeError exception is thrown. Previous editions did not specify the behaviour for that case.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-date.prototype.tostring"></emu-xref>: Previous editions did not specify the value returned by Date.prototype.toString when this time value is *NaN*. ECMAScript 2015 specifies the result to be the String value is `"Invalid Date"`.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-pattern-flags"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-escaperegexppattern"></emu-xref>: Any LineTerminator code points in the value of the `source` property of an RegExp instance must be expressed using an escape sequence. Edition 5.1 only required the escaping of `"/"`.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-regexp.prototype-@@match"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-regexp.prototype-@@replace"></emu-xref>: In previous editions, the specifications for `String.prototype.match` and `String.prototype.replace` was incorrect for cases where the pattern argument was a RegExp value whose `global` is flag set. The previous specifications stated that for each attempt to match the pattern, if `lastIndex` did not change it should be incremented by 1. The correct behaviour is that `lastIndex` should be incremented by one only if the pattern matched the empty string.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-array.prototype.sort"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-sortcompare"></emu-xref>: Previous editions did not specify how a *NaN* value returned by a _comparefn_ was interpreted by `Array.prototype.sort`. ECMAScript 2015 specifies that such as value is treated as if *+0* was returned from the _comparefn_. ECMAScript 2015 also specifies that ToNumber is applied to the result returned by a _comparefn_. In previous editions, the effect of a _comparefn_ result that is not a Number value was implementation dependent. In practice, implementations call ToNumber.</p>

<emu-annex id="sec-additions-and-changes-that-introduce-incompatibilities-with-prior-editions">
  <h1>Additions and Changes That Introduce Incompatibilities with Prior Editions</h1>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-tonumber-applied-to-the-string-type"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, ToNumber applied to a String value now recognizes and converts |BinaryIntegerLiteral| and |OctalIntegerLiteral| numeric strings. In previous editions such strings were converted to *NaN*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-reference-specification-type"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, Function calls are not allowed to return a Reference value.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-names-and-keywords"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the valid code points for an |IdentifierName| are specified in terms of the Unicode properties &ldquo;ID_Start&rdquo; and &ldquo;ID_Continue&rdquo;. In previous editions, the valid |IdentifierName| or |Identifier| code points were specified by enumerating various Unicode code point categories.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-rules-of-automatic-semicolon-insertion"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, Automatic Semicolon Insertion adds a semicolon at the end of a do-while statement if the semicolon is missing. This change aligns the specification with the actual behaviour of most existing implementations.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object-initializer-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, it is no longer an early error to have duplicate property names in Object Initializers.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-assignment-operators-static-semantics-early-errors"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, strict mode code containing an assignment to an immutable binding such as the function name of a |FunctionExpression| does not produce an early error. Instead it produces a runtime error.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-block"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, a |StatementList| beginning with the token let followed by the input elements |LineTerminator| then |Identifier| is the start of a |LexicalDeclaration|. In previous editions, automatic semicolon insertion would always insert a semicolon before the |Identifier| input element.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-expression-statement"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, a |StatementListItem| beginning with the token `let` followed by the token `[` is the start of a |LexicalDeclaration|. In previous editions such a sequence would be the start of an |ExpressionStatement|.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-if-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the normal completion value of an |IfStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If no |Statement| part is evaluated or if the evaluated |Statement| part produces a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |IfStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the `(` token of a for statement is immediately followed by the token sequence `let [` then the `let` is treated as the start of a |LexicalDeclaration|. In previous editions such a token sequence would be the start of an |Expression|.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the ( token of a for-in statement is immediately followed by the token sequence `let [` then the `let` is treated as the start of a |ForDeclaration|. In previous editions such a token sequence would be the start of an |LeftHandSideExpression|.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: Prior to ECMAScript 2015, an initialization expression could appear as part of the |VariableDeclaration| that precedes the `in` keyword. The value of that expression was always discarded. In ECMAScript 2015, the _ForBinding_ in that same position does not allow the occurrence of such an initializer.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-iteration-statements"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the completion value of an |IterationStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If the |Statement| part of an |IterationStatement| is not evaluated or if the final evaluation of the |Statement| part produces a completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |IterationStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-with-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the normal completion value of a |WithStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If evaluation of the |Statement| part of a |WithStatement| produces a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |WithStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-switch-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the completion value of a |SwitchStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If the |CaseBlock| part of a |SwitchStatement| produces a completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |SwitchStatement| is *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, it is an early error for a |Catch| clause to contain a `var` declaration for the same |Identifier| that appears as the |Catch| clause parameter. In previous editions, such a variable declaration would be instantiated in the enclosing variable environment but the declaration's |Initializer| value would be assigned to the |Catch| parameter.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement"></emu-xref>, <emu-xref href="#sec-evaldeclarationinstantiation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, a runtime *SyntaxError* is thrown if a |Catch| clause evaluates a non-strict direct `eval` whose eval code includes a `var` or `FunctionDeclaration` declaration that binds the same |Identifier| that appears as the |Catch| clause parameter.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-try-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the completion value of a |TryStatement| is never the value ~empty~. If the |Block| part of a |TryStatement| evaluates to a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |TryStatement| is *undefined*. If the |Block| part of a |TryStatement| evaluates to a throw completion and it has a |Catch| part that evaluates to a normal completion whose value is ~empty~, the completion value of the |TryStatement| is *undefined* if there is no |Finally| clause or if its |Finally| clause evalulates to an ~empty~ normal completion.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-method-definitions-runtime-semantics-propertydefinitionevaluation"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the function objects that are created as the values of the [[Get]] or [[Set]] attribute of accessor properties in an |ObjectLiteral| are not constructor functions and they do not have a `prototype` own property. In the previous edition, they were constructors and had a `prototype` property.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.freeze"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.freeze` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.getownpropertydescriptor"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.getownpropertynames"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.getprototypeof"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.getPrototypeOf` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.isextensible"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.isExtensible` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.isfrozen"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.isFrozen` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.issealed"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.isSealed` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.keys"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.keys` is not an object an attempt is made to coerce the argument using ToObject. If the coercion is successful the result is used in place of the original argument value. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.preventextensions"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.preventExtensions` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-object.seal"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, if the argument to `Object.seal` is not an object it is treated as if it was a non-extensible ordinary object with no own properties. In the previous edition, a non-object argument always causes a *TypeError* to be thrown.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-function.prototype.bind"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a bound function is set to the [[GetPrototypeOf]] value of its target function. In the previous edition, [[Prototype]] was always set to %FunctionPrototype%.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-function-instances-length"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the `length` property of function instances is configurable. In previous editions it was non-configurable.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-nativeerror-constructors"></emu-xref>: In ECMAScript 2015, the [[Prototype]] internal slot of a _NativeError_ constructor is the Error constructor. In previous editions it was the Function prototype object.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-date-prototype-object"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the Date prototype object is not a Date instance. In previous editions it was a Date instance whose TimeValue was *NaN*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.localecompare"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the `String.prototype.localeCompare` function must treat Strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as being identical. In previous editions implementations were permitted to ignore canonical equivalence and could instead use a bit-wise comparison.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.tolowercase"></emu-xref> and <emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.touppercase"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, lowercase/upper conversion processing operates on code points. In previous editions such the conversion processing was only applied to individual code units. The only affected code points are those in the Deseret block of Unicode</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-string.prototype.trim"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the `String.prototype.trim` method is defined to recognize white space code points that may exists outside of the Unicode BMP. However, as of Unicode 7 no such code points are defined. In previous editions such code points would not have been recognized as white space.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-regexp-pattern-flags"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, If the _pattern_ argument is a RegExp instance and the _flags_ argument is not *undefined*, a new RegExp instance is created just like _pattern_ except that _pattern_'s flags are replaced by the argument _flags_. In previous editions a *TypeError* exception was thrown when _pattern_ was a RegExp instance and _flags_ was not *undefined*.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-regexp-prototype-object"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, the RegExp prototype object is not a RegExp instance. In previous editions it was a RegExp instance whose pattern is the empty string.</p>
  <p><emu-xref href="#sec-properties-of-the-regexp-prototype-object"></emu-xref> In ECMAScript 2015, `source`, `global`, `ignoreCase`, and `multiline` are accessor properties defined on the RegExp prototype object. In previous editions they were data properties defined on RegExp instances</p>
